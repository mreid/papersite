  abstract = {Counterexample analysis has emerged as one of the key challenges in Angluin-style
active automata learning.  Rivest and Schapire (1993) showed for the $\mathrm{L}^*$ algorithm that
a single suffix of the counterexample was sufficient to ensure progress. 
This suffix can be obtained in a binary search fashion, requiring $\Theta(\log m)$ membership queries
for a counterexample of length $m$. Correctly implementing this algorithm can be quite tricky,
and its correctness sometimes even has been disputed. In this paper, we establish an abstract
framework for counterexample analysis, which basically reduces the problem of finding a suffix
to finding distinct neighboring elements in a $0/1$ sequence, where the first element is $0$
and the last element is $1$. We demonstrate the conciseness and simplicity of our framework
by using it to present new counterexample analysis algorithms, which, while maintaining
the worst-case complexity of $O(\log m)$, perform significantly better in practice. Furthermore,
we contribute---in a second instantiation of our framework, highlighting its generality---the
first sublinear counterexample analysis procedures for the algorithm due to
Kearns and Vazirani (1994).},
