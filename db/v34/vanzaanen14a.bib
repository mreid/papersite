  abstract = {Grammatical inference deals with learning of grammars describing
  languages.  Formal grammatical inference aims at identifying
  families of languages that have a shared property, which can be used
  to prove efficient learnability of the families formally.  In
  contrast, in empirical grammatical inference research, practical
  systems are developed that are applied to languages.  The
  effectiveness of these systems is measured by comparing the learned
  grammar against a Gold standard which indicates the ground truth.
  From successful empirical learnability results, either shared properties
  may be identified, leading to further formal learnability results,
  or modifications to the systems may be made, improving practical
  results.  Proper evaluation of empirical systems is, therefore,
  essential.  Here, we evaluate and compare existing state-of-the-art
  context-free grammar learning systems (and novel systems based on
  combinations of existing phases) in a standardized evaluation
  environment (on a corpus of plain natural language sentences),
  illustrating future directions for empirical grammatical inference
  research.},
