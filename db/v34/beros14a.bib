  abstract = {We prove the existence of a canonical form for semi-deterministic transducers with sets of pairwise incomparable output strings.  Based on this, we develop an algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to translation queries.  We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for semi-deterministic transducers that uses only domain knowledge.},
