  abstract = {Multi-fold cross-validation is an established practice to estimate the error rate   of a learning algorithm.  Quantifying the variance reduction gains due to cross-validation   has been challenging due to the inherent correlations introduced by the folds.    In this work we introduce a new and weak measure of stability called \emph{loss stability}  and relate the cross-validation performance to loss stability; we also establish that this   relationship is near-optimal.  Our work thus quantitatively improves the current  best bounds on cross-validation.},
