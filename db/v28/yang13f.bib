  abstract = {Quantile regression is a method to estimate the quantiles of the   conditional distribution of a response variable, and as such it permits a   much more accurate portrayal of the relationship between the response variable   and observed covariates than methods such as Least-squares or   Least Absolute Deviations regression.  It can be expressed as a linear program,   and   interior-point methods can be used to find a solution for  moderately large problems.  Dealing with very large problems, \emph{e.g.}, involving data up to and   beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge.  Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in time that is nearly   linear in the size of the input and that, with constant probability,   computes a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile   regression problem.  Our algorithm computes a low-distortion subspace-preserving  embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile regression.  Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is competitive with   the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and that   it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and    applied to terabyte-sized problems.},
