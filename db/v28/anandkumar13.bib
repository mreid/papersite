  abstract = {This work considers the problem of learning linear Bayesian networks when  some of the variables are unobserved.  Identifiability and efficient recovery from low-order observable moments  are established under a novel graphical constraint.  The constraint concerns the expansion properties of the underlying directed  acyclic graph (DAG) between observed and unobserved variables in the  network, and it is satisfied by many natural families of DAGs that include  multi-level DAGs, DAGs with effective depth one, as well as certain  families of polytrees.  },
