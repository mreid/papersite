  abstract = {We propose an algorithmic framework for convex minimization problems of composite functions with two terms:  a self-concordant part and a possibly nonsmooth regularization part.  Our method is a new proximal Newton algorithm with local quadratic convergence rate. As a specific problem instance, we consider sparse precision matrix estimation problems in graph learning. Via a careful dual formulation and a novel analytic step-size selection, we instantiate an algorithm within our framework for graph learning that avoids Cholesky decompositions and matrix inversions, making it attractive for parallel and distributed implementations. },
