  abstract = {We present and analyze a theoretical model designed to understand and  explain the effectiveness of ontologies for learning multiple related  tasks from primarily unlabeled data.  We present both  information-theoretic results as well as efficient algorithms.    We show in this model that an ontology, which specifies the  relationships between multiple outputs, in some cases is sufficient  to completely learn a classification using a large unlabeled data  source.},
