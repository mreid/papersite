  abstract = {Sparse estimation methods based on l1 relaxation,  such as the Lasso and the Dantzig  selector, require the knowledge of the variance  of the noise in order to properly tune the  regularization parameter. This constitutes a   major obstacle in applying these methods in  several frameworks, such as time series, random fields, inverse problems, for which noise  is rarely homoscedastic and the noise level is  hard to know in advance.  In this paper, we  propose a new approach to the joint estimation  of the conditional mean and the conditional  variance in a high-dimensional (auto-)  regression setting.   An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is   that it is efficiently computable even for very large   scale problems by solving a second-order cone program  (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and  numerical results assessing the performance  of the proposed procedure.},
