  abstract = {We propose a sampling scheme suitable for reducing a data set prior to  selecting a hypothesis with minimum empirical risk.  The sampling only  considers a subset of the ultimate (unknown) hypothesis set, but can  nonetheless guarantee that the final excess risk will compare favorably  with utilizing the entire original data set. We demonstrate the practical  benefits of our approach on a large dataset which we subsample and  subsequently fit with boosted trees.},
