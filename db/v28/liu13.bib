  abstract = {We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a  measurement matrix $\Phi\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ and a noisy  observation vector $c\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ constructed from $c =  \Phi\theta^* + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the  noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian  distribution, how to recover the signal $\theta^*$ if $D\theta^*$ is  sparse {\rca under a linear transformation} $D\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times  p}$? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the  following problem: $$\min_{\theta}~{1\over 2}\|\Phi\theta - c\|^2 +  \lambda\|D\theta\|_1.$$ This paper provides an upper bound of the  estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by  assuming that the design matrix $\Phi$ is a Gaussian random matrix.  Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition  number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement number $n\geq  \Omega(s\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number, then the true  solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy  case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement  increases faster than $s\log(p)$, that is, $s\log(p)=o(n)$, the  estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$  go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the  special case $D=\bold{I}_{p\times p}$ (equivalently LASSO) and  improve the existing analysis. The condition number of $D$ plays a  critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in  two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the  condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant,  while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with  high probability if $m\over p$ (i.e., $\#\text{edge}\over  \#\text{vertex}$) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical  simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.},
