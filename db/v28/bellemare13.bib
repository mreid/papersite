  abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning techniques have historically encountered a number of difficulties scaling up to large observation spaces. One promising approach has been to decompose the model learning task into a number of smaller, more manageable sub-problems by factoring the observation space. Typically, many different factorizations are possible, which can make it difficult to select an appropriate factorization without extensive testing. In this paper we introduce the class of recursively decomposable factorizations, and show how exact Bayesian inference can be used to efficiently guarantee predictive performance close to the best factorization in this class. We demonstrate the strength of this approach by presenting a collection of empirical results for 20 different Atari 2600 games.  },
