  abstract = {For a given target node \emph{T} and a given depth \emph{k ≥ 1}, we propose an algorithm for discovering a local causal network around the target \emph{T} to depth \emph{k}. In our algorithm, we find parents, children and some descendants (PCD) of nodes stepwise away from the target \emph{T} until all edges within the depth \emph{k} local network cannot be oriented further. Our algorithm extends the PCD-by-PCD algorithm for prediction with intervention presented in Yin et al. (2008). Our algorithm can construct a local network to depth \emph{k}, has a more efficient stop rule and finds PCDs along some but not all paths starting from the target.},
