  abstract = {Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models are popular tools for describing causal relationships and for guiding attempts to learn them from data.  They appear to supply a means of extracting causal conclusions from probabilistic conditional independence properties inferred from purely observational data.  I take a critical look at  this enterprise, and suggest that it is in need of more, and more explicit, methodological and philosophical justification than it typically receives. In particular, I argue for the value of a clean separation between formal causal language and intuitive causal assumptions.},
