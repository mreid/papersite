  abstract = {We present an efficient method for training slack-rescaled   structural SVM. Although finding the most violating label in a   margin-rescaled formulation is often easy since the target function   decomposes with respect to the structure, this is not the case for a   slack-rescaled formulation, and finding the most violated label   might be very difficult.  Our core contribution is an efficient   method for finding the most-violating-label in a slack-rescaled   formulation, given an oracle that returns the most-violating-label   in a (slightly modified) margin-rescaled formulation.  We show that   our method enables accurate and scalable training for slack-rescaled   SVMs, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude compared to previous approaches to slack-rescaled SVMs.},
