  abstract = {This paper focuses on analysing multiple time series relationships such as correlations
between them. We develop a solution for the Connectiomics contest dataset of fluorescence
imaging of neural activity recordings the aim is reconstruction of the wiring between brain
neurons. The model is implemented to achieve high evaluation score. Our model took the
fourth place in this contest. The performance is similar to the other leading solutions,
thus we showed that deep learning methods for time series processing are comparable to
the other approaches and have wide opportunities for further improvement. We discuss a
range of methods and code optimisations applied for the convolutional neural network for
the time series domain.},
