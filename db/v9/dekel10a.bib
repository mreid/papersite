  abstract = {We discuss multiclass-multilabel classification problems in which   the set of possible labels is extremely large. Most existing   multiclass-multilabel learning algorithms expect to observe a   reasonably large sample from each class, and fail if they receive   only a handful of examples with a given label. We propose and   analyze the following two-stage approach: first use an arbitrary   (perhaps heuristic) classification algorithm to construct an initial   classifier, then apply a simple but principled method to augment   this classifier by removing harmful labels from its output.  A   careful theoretical analysis allows us to justify our approach under   some reasonable conditions (such as label sparsity and power-law   distribution of label frequencies), even when the training set does   not provide a statistically accurate representation of most   classes. Surprisingly, our theoretical analysis continues to hold   even when the number of classes exceeds the sample size. We   demonstrate the merits of our approach on the ambitious task of   categorizing the entire web using the 1.5 million categories   defined on Wikipedia.},
