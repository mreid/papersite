  abstract = {We introduce a new method -- the  group Dantzig selector -- for high dimensional sparse regression with  group structure, which has a convincing theory about why utilizing the group structure can be beneficial. Under a  group restricted isometry condition,  we obtain a significantly improved nonasymptotic L2-norm bound over the basis pursuit or the Dantzig selector which ignores the group structure.   To gain more insight, we also introduce a surprisingly simple and intuitive  ``sparsity oracle condition'' to obtain a block L1-norm bound,  which is easily accessible to a broad audience in machine learning community. Encouraging numerical results are also provided to support our theory.},
