  abstract = {We consider linear ill-posed inverse problems y=Ax, in which we want to infer many count parameters x from few count observations y, where the matrix A is binary and has some unimodularity property. Such problems are typical in applications such as contingency table analysis and network tomography (on which we present testing results).   These properties of A have a geometrical implication for the solution space: It is a convex integer polytope.   We develop a novel approach to characterize this polytope in terms of its vertices;    by taking advantage of the geometrical intuitions behind the Hermite normal form decomposition of the matrix A, and of a newly defined pivoting operation to travel across vertices.   Next, we use this characterization to develop three (exact) polytope samplers for x with emphasis on uniform distributions.   We showcase one of these samplers on simulated and real data.
