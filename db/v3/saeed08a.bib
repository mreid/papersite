  abstract = {This paper presents the use of Bernoulli mixture models for Markov blanket  filtering and classification of binary data. Bernoulli mixture models can  be seen as a tool for partitioning an n-dimensional hypercube, identifying  regions of high data density on the corners of the hypercube. Once Bernoulli  mixture models are computed from a training dataset we use them for determining  the Markov blanket of the target variable. An algorithm for Markov blanket  filtering was proposed by Koller and Sahami (1996), which is a greedy search   method for feature subset selection and it outputs an approximation to the  optimal feature selection criterion. However, they use the entire training  instances for computing the conditioning sets and have to limit the size of these sets for computational efficiency and avoiding data fragmentation. We have adapted their algorithm to use Bernoulli mixture models instead, hence, overcoming the short comings of their algorithm and increasing the  efficiency of this algorithm considerably. Once a feature subset is identified we perform classification using these mixture models. We have applied this algorithm to the causality challenge datasets. Our prediction scores were ranked fourth on SIDO and our feature scores were ranked the best for test sets 1 and 2 of the same dataset.},
