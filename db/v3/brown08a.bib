  abstract = {The first Causality Challenge competition posted several causal discovery  problems that require researchers to employ the full arsenal of state-of-the-art  causal discovery methods, while prompting the development of new ones. Our  approach used the formalism of Causal Bayesian Networks to model and induce  causal relations and to make predictions about the effects of the manipulation  of the variables. Using state-of-the-art, under development, or newly invented  methods specifically for the purposes of the competition, we addressed the  following problems in turn in order to build and evaluate a model: (a) finding  the Markov Blanket of the target even under some non-faithfulness conditions  (e.g., parity functions), (b) reducing the problems to a size manageable by subsequent algorithms, (c) identifying and orienting the network edges, (d) identifying causal edges (i.e., not confounded), and (e) selecting the causal Markov Blanket of the target in the manipulated distribution. The results of the competition illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of the state-of-the-art of causal discovery methods and point to new directions in the field. An implementation of our approach is available at http://www.dsl-lab.org  for use by other researchers.},
