  abstract = {Many real-world applications require multi-label classification where multiple target labels are assigned to each instance. In multi-label classification, there exist the intrinsic correlations between the labels and features. These correlations are beneficial for multi-label classification task since they reflect the coexistence of the input and output spaces that can be exploited for prediction. Traditional classification methods have attempted to reveal these correlations in different ways. However, existing methods demand expensive computation complexity for finding such correlation structures. Furthermore, these approaches can not identify the suitable number of label-feature correlation patterns. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) framework for multi-label classification that can automatically learn and exploit the unknown number of multi-label correlation. We utilize the recent techniques in stochastic inference to derive the cheap (but efficient) posterior inference algorithm for the model. In addition, our model can naturally exploit the useful information from missing label samples. Furthermore, we extend the model to update parameters in an online fashion that highlights the flexibility of our model against the existing approaches. We compare our method with the state-of-the-art multi-label classification algorithms on real-world datasets using both complete and missing label settings. Our model achieves better classification accuracy while our running time is consistently much faster than the baselines in an order of magnitude.},
