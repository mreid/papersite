  abstract = {Recommendation has become a key feature in the economy of a lot of   companies (online shopping, search engines...). There is a lot of   work going on regarding recommender systems and there is still a lot   to do to improve them. Indeed nowadays in many companies most of the   job is done by hand. Moreover even when a supposedly smart   recommender system is designed, it is hard to evaluate it without   using real audience which obviously involves economic issues. The   ICML Exploration & Exploitation challenge is an attempt to make   people propose efficient recommendation techniques and particularly   focuses on limited computational resources. The challenge also   proposes a framework to address the problem of evaluating a   recommendation algorithm with real data. We took part in this   challenge and achieved the best performances; this paper aims at   reporting on this achievement; we also discuss the evaluation   process and propose a better one for future challenges of the   same kind.},
