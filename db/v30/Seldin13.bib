  abstract = {Adversarial multiarmed bandits with expert advice is one of the fundamental problems in studying the exploration-exploitation trade-off. It is known that if we observe the advice of all experts on every round we can achieve $O\left(\sqrt{KT \ln N}\right)$ regret, where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the number of game rounds, and $N$ is the number of experts. It is also known that if we observe the advice of just one expert on every round, we can achieve regret of order $O\left(\sqrt{NT}\right)$. Our open problem is what can be achieved by asking $M$ experts on every round, where $1<M<N$. },
