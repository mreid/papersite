  abstract = {The deterministic finite automata (DFA) learning algorithm \emph{L*} has been extended to learn Mealy machine models which are more succinct for \emph{input/output (i/o)} based systems.  We propose an optimized learning algorithm \emph{L_{1}} to infer Mealy models of software black box components. The \emph{L_{1}} algorithm uses a modified observation table and avoids adding unnecessary elements to its columns and rows.  The proposed improvements reduce the worst case time complexity. The \emph{L_{1}} algorithm is compared with the existing Mealy inference algorithms and the experiments conducted on a comprehensive set confirm the gain.},
