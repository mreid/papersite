  abstract = {In this paper we present a system that assigns interpretations, in   the form of shallow semantic frame descriptions, to natural language   sentences.  The system searches for relevant patterns, consisting of   words from the sentences, to identify the correct semantic frame and   associated slot values.  For each of these choices, a separate   classifier is trained.  Each classifier learns the boundaries   between different languages, which each correspond to a particular   class.  The different classifiers each have their own viewpoint on   the data depending on which aspect needs to be identified.},
