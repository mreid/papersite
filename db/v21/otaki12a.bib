  abstract = {We formalize generating processes of strings based on patterns and  substitutions, and give an algorithm to estimate a probability mass  function on substitutions, which is an element of processes.  Patterns are non-empty sequences of characters and variables.  Variables indicate unknown substrings and are replaced with other  patterns by substitutions.  By introducing variables and  substitutions, we can deal with the difficulty of preparing  production rules in generative grammar and of representing  context-sensitivity with them.  Our key idea is to regard sequences  of substitutions as generations of strings, and to give probabilities  of substitutions like PCFG.  In this study, after giving a problem to  estimate a probability mass function from strings based on our  formalization, we solve it by the Passing algorithm that runs in an  iterative manner.  Our experimental results with synthetic strings  show that our method estimates probability mass functions with  sufficient small errors.},
