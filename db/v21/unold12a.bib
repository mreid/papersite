  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the location of amyloidogenic regions in proteins.  The language of protein sequence can be described by using a formal system such as fuzzy context-free grammar, and the problem of amyloidogenic region recognition can be replaced by fuzzy grammar induction.  The induced fuzzy grammar achieved 70.6\% accuracy and 96.7\% specificity on a recently published amyloidogenic dataset.  Our results are comparable to other methods dedicated to recognize amyloid proteins.},
