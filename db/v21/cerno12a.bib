  abstract = {Clearing and subword-clearing restarting automata are linguistically motivated models of automata. We investigate the problem of grammatical inference for such automata based on the given set of positive and negative samples.  We show that it is possible to identify these models in the limit. In this way we can learn a large class of languages. On the other hand, we prove that the task of finding a clearing restarting automaton consistent with a given set of positive and negative samples is NP-hard, provided that we impose an upper bound on the width of its instructions.},
