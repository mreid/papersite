  abstract = {Flow cytometry is a technique for rapidly quantifying physical and chemical properties of large numbers of cells. In clinical applications, flow cytometry data must be manually ``gated'' to identify cell populations of interest. While several researchers have investigated statistical methods for automating this process, most of them falls under the framework of unsupervised learning and mixture model fitting. We view the problem as one of transfer learning, which can leverage existing datasets previously gated by experts to automatically gate a new flow cytometry dataset while accounting for biological variation. We illustrate our proposed method by automatically gating lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples.},
