  abstract = {Although recent work in non-linear dimensionality reduction investigates multiple choices of divergence measure during optimization~\cite{yang2013icml,bunte2012neuro}, little work discusses the direct effects that divergence measures have on visualization. We study this relationship, theoretically and through an empirical analysis over 10 datasets. Our works shows how the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters of the generalized alpha-beta divergence can be chosen to discover hidden macro-structures (categories, e.g. birds) or micro-structures (fine-grained classes, e.g. toucans). Our method, which generalizes t-SNE~\cite{tsne}, allows us to discover such structure without extensive grid searches over $(\alpha, \beta)$ due to our theoretical analysis: such structure is apparent with particular choices of $(\alpha, \beta)$ that generalize across datasets. We also discuss efficient parallel CPU and GPU schemes which are non-trivial due to the tree-structures employed in optimization and the large datasets that do not fully fit into GPU memory. Our method runs 20x faster than the fastest published code~\cite{fmm}. We conclude with detailed case studies on the following very large datasets: ILSVRC 2012, a standard computer vision dataset with 1.2M images; SUSY, a particle physics dataset with 5M instances; and HIGGS, another particle physics dataset with 11M instances. This represents the largest published visualization attained by SNE methods. We have open-sourced our visualization code: \texttt{http://rll.berkeley.edu/absne/}.},
