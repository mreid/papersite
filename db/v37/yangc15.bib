  abstract = {We propose a unified framework for making a wide range of PCA-like algorithms -- including the standard PCA, sparse PCA and non-negative sparse PCA, etc. -- robust when facing a constant fraction of arbitrarily corrupted outliers. Our theoretic analysis establishes solid performance guarantees of the proposed framework: its estimation error is upper bounded by a term depending on the intrinsic parameters of the data model, the selected PCA-like algorithm and the fraction of outliers. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the outlier-robust PCA-like algorithms derived from our framework have outstanding performance.},
