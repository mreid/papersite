  abstract = {We introduce a new model of teaching named
``preference-based teaching'' and a corresponding complexity
parameter---the preference-based teaching dimension
(PBTD)---representing the worst-case number of examples
needed to teach any concept in a given concept class. Although
the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching
dimension (RTD) on finite classes,
it is radically different on infinite ones:
the RTD becomes infinite already for
trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals)
whereas the PBTD evaluates to
reasonably small values for a wide collection
of infinite classes including classes consisting
of so-called closed sets w.r.t.~a given closure
operator, including various classes related to
linear sets over $\mathbb{N}_0$ (whose RTD had been
studied quite recently) and including the class
of Euclidean half-spaces (and some other geometric
classes). On top of presenting these concrete
results, we provide the reader with a theoretical
framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which
helps to derive bounds on the PBTD.},
