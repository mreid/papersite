  title = {Unsupervised Feature Selection for Pattern Discovery in Seismic Wavefields},
  abstract = {This study presents an unsupervised feature selection approach for the discovery
 of significant patterns in seismic wavefields. We iteratively reduce the number
 of features generated from seismic time series by first considering significance
 of individual features. Significance testing is done by assessing the randomness
 of the time series with the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test and by comparing observed and
 theoretical variability of features. In a second step the in-between feature
 dependencies are assessed based on correlation hunting in feature subsets using
 Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We show the improved discriminative power of our 
procedure compared to manually selected feature subsets by cross-validation applied 
to synthetic seismic wavefield data. Furthermore, we apply the method to real-world
 data with the aim to define suitable features for earthquake detection and seismic
 phase classification in seismic recordings.},
