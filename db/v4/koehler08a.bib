  abstract = {This study presents an unsupervised feature selection approach for the discovery  of significant patterns in seismic wavefields. We iteratively reduce the number  of features generated from seismic time series by first considering significance  of individual features. Significance testing is done by assessing the randomness  of the time series with the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test and by comparing observed and  theoretical variability of features. In a second step the in-between feature  dependencies are assessed based on correlation hunting in feature subsets using  Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). We show the improved discriminative power of our  procedure compared to manually selected feature subsets by cross-validation applied  to synthetic seismic wavefield data. Furthermore, we apply the method to real-world  data with the aim to define suitable features for earthquake detection and seismic  phase classification in seismic recordings.},
