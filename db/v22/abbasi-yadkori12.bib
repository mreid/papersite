  abstract = {We introduce a novel technique, which we call  online-to-confidence-set conversion. The technique allows us to construct high-probability confidence sets for linear prediction  with correlated inputs given the predictions of any algorithm   (e.g., online LASSO, exponentiated gradient algorithm,   online least-squares, p-norm algorithm)   targeting online learning  with linear predictors and the quadratic loss. By construction, the size of the confidence set is   directly governed by the regret of the online learning algorithm. Constructing tight confidence sets is interesting on its own, but  the new technique is given extra weight by the fact   having access tight confidence sets underlies a number of    important problems. The advantage of our construction here is that  progress in constructing better algorithms for online prediction problems   directly translates into tighter confidence sets. In this paper, this is demonstrated in the case of linear stochastic bandits. In particular, we introduce the sparse variant of linear stochastic  bandits and show that a recent online algorithm together with our  online-to-confidence-set conversion allows one to derive  algorithms that can exploit if the reward is a function of a sparse   linear combination of the components of the chosen action.},
