  abstract = {Variable selection is an important practical problem that arises in   analysis of many high-dimensional datasets. Convex optimization   procedures, that arise from relaxing the NP-hard subset selection   procedure, e.g., the Lasso or Dantzig selector, have become the   focus of intense theoretical investigations. Although many efficient   algorithms exist that solve these problems, finding a solution when   the number of variables is large, e.g., several hundreds of   thousands in problems arising in genome-wide association analysis,   is still computationally challenging. A practical solution for these   high-dimensional problems is the marginal regression, where the   output is regressed on each variable separately. We investigate   theoretical properties of the marginal regression in a multitask   framework. Our contribution include: i) sharp analysis for the   marginal regression in a single task setting with random design, ii)   sufficient conditions for the multitask screening to select the   relevant variables, iii) a lower bound on the Hamming distance   convergence for multitask variable selection problems. A simulation   study further demonstrates the performance of the marginal   regression.},
