  abstract = {Traditional MCMC methods are only applicable to distributions which can be defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, there exist many application domains where the distributions cannot easily be defined on a Euclidean space. To address this limitation, we propose a general constrained version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and  give conditions under which the Markov chain  is convergent. Based on this general framework we define a family of MCMC methods which can be applied to sample from distributions on non-linear manifolds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  on a variety of problems including sampling from the Bingham-von Mises-Fisher distribution, collaborative filtering and  human pose estimation.},
