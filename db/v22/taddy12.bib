  abstract = {This article describes posterior maximization for topic models, identifying computational and   conceptual gains from inference under a non-standard    parametrization.  We then show that fitted parameters can be used  as the basis for a novel approach to marginal likelihood estimation,   via block-diagonal approximation to the information matrix, that facilitates choosing the number of latent topics.  This   likelihood-based model selection is complemented with a goodness-of-fit analysis built around estimated residual dispersion.  Examples are provided to illustrate model selection as well as to compare our estimation against standard alternative techniques.},
