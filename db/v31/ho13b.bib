  abstract = {Cardiac arrest is a deadly condition caused by a sudden failure of the heart with an in-hospital mortality rate of $\sim 80\%$. Therefore, the ability to accurately estimate patients at high risk of cardiac arrest is crucial for improving the survival rate. Existing research generally fails to utilize a patient's temporal dynamics. In this paper, we present two dynamic cardiac risk estimation models, focusing on different temporal signatures in a patient's risk trajectory. These models can track a patient's risk trajectory in real time, allow interpretability and predictability of a cardiac arrest event, provide an intuitive visualization to medical professionals, offer a personalized dynamic hazard function, and estimate the risk for a new patient.},
