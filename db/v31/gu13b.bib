  abstract = {In many problems of machine learning, the data are distributed nonlinearly. One way to address this kind of data is training a nonlinear classifier such as kernel support vector machine (kernel SVM). However, the computational burden of kernel SVM limits its application to large scale datasets. In this paper, we propose a Clustered Support Vector Machine (CSVM), which tackles the data in a divide and conquer manner. More specifically, CSVM groups the data into several clusters, followed which it trains a linear support vector machine in each cluster to separate the data locally. Meanwhile, CSVM has an additional global regularization, which requires the weight vector of each local linear SVM aligning with a global weight vector. The global regularization leverages the information from one cluster to another, and avoids over-fitting in each cluster. We derive a data-dependent generalization error bound for CSVM, which explains the advantage of CSVM over linear SVM. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms linear SVM and some other related locally linear classifiers. It is also comparable to a fine-tuned kernel SVM in terms of prediction performance, while it is more efficient than kernel SVM.},
