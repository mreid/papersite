  abstract = {We introduce the concept of a Modular Autoencoder (MAE), capable of learning a set of diverse but complementary representations from unlabelled data, that can later be used for supervised tasks. The learning of the representations is controlled by a trade-off parameter, and we show on six benchmark datasets the optimum lies between two extremes: a set of smaller, independent autoencoders each with low capacity, versus a single monolithic encoding, outperforming an appropriate baseline. In the present paper we explore the special case of linear MAE, and derive an SVD-based algorithm which converges several orders of magnitude faster than gradient descent.},
