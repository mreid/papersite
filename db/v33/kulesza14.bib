  abstract = {"Spectral learning methods have recently been proposed as  alternatives to slow, non-convex optimization algorithms like EM for  a variety of probabilistic models in which hidden information must  be inferred by the learner.  These methods are typically controlled  by a rank hyperparameter that sets the complexity of the model; when  the model rank matches the true rank of the process generating the  data, the resulting predictions are provably consistent and admit  finite sample convergence bounds.  However, in practice we usually  do not know the true rank, and, in any event, from a computational  and statistical standpoint it is likely to be prohibitively large.  It is therefore of great practical interest to understand the  behavior of low-rank spectral learning, where the model rank is   less than the true rank.  Counterintuitively, we show that even   when the singular values omitted by lowering the rank are   arbitrarily small, the resulting prediction errors can in fact be  arbitrarily large.  We identify two distinct possible causes for  this bad behavior, and illustrate them with simple examples.  We  then show that these two causes are essentially complete: assuming  that they do not occur, we can prove that the prediction error is  bounded in terms of the magnitudes of the omitted singular values.  We argue that the assumptions necessary for this result are  relatively realistic, making low-rank spectral learning a viable  option for many applications."},
