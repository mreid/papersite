  abstract = {This paper investigates visual boundary detection, i.e.\ prediction   of the presence of a boundary at a given image location. We develop a   novel neurally-inspired deep architecture for the task. Notable   aspects of our work are (i) the use of ``covariance features''  [Ranzato and Hinton, 2010] which depend on the \emph{squared} response   of a filter to the input image, and (ii) the integration of image   information from multiple scales and semantic levels via multiple   streams of interlinked, layered, and non-linear ``deep''   processing. Our results on the Berkeley Segmentation Data Set   500 (BSDS500) show comparable or better performance to the   top-performing methods  [Arbelaez et al., 2011, Ren and Bo, 2012, Lim et al., 2013, Doll ́ar  and Zitnick, 2013]  with effective inference times. We also propose novel quantitative assessment techniques for improved method understanding and comparison. We  carefully dissect the performance of our architecture,  feature-types used and training methods, providing clear signals for model understanding and development.},
