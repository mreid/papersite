  abstract = {This paper describes ongoing research work by the Pattern Recognition and Human Language Technology (PRHLT) group (UPV PASCAL2 node) in two important technology transfer projects: i3media and erudito.com. On the one hand, i3media (2007-2010) is a 35M€ ``tractor'' technology project within the Spanish Programa CENIT-Ingenio 2010, run through a consortium of 12 main enterprises of the media sector, which also involve 19 research groups, including PRHLT. i3media focuses on the creation and automated management of intelligent audiovisual content, so as to facilitate both, content personalisation and interaction with users (i3media.barcelonamedia.org). Our participation in i3media is centred on interactive machine translation, to transfer and adapt our experience on this technology to i3media-specific needs. On the other hand, erudito.com (2010-2012) is a 1.4M€ experimental design project, supported by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade under the Avanza I+D program, aimed at developing a tool to encapsulate, distribute and intelligently use digital content such as that showed on thematic TV channels. In this project, PRHLT contributes to the development of interactive closed captioning (speech transcription) and machine translation tools.},
