  abstract = {Imitation learning is an increasingly important tool for both developing  automatic decision making systems as well as for learning to predict  decision-making and behavior by observation. Two basic approaches are common:  the first, which we here term \emph{behavioral cloning}   (BC)\cite{BehavioralCloning,ALVINN,DAVE}, treats the imitation learning problem  as a straightforward one of supervised learning (e.g. classification) where the  goal is to map observations to controls.  Secondly, the notion of\emph{inverse  optimal control} (IOC) \cite{BoydIOC,ng00irl,Abbeel04c,mmp06} for  modeling   such decision making behavior has gained prominence as it allows for learned   decision-making that reasons sequentially and over a long horizon.  Unfortunately, such inverse optimal control methods rely upon the ability to   efficiently solve a planning problem and suffer from the usual ``curse of  dimensionality'' when the state space gets large. This paper presents a novel  approach to imitation learning that we call \emph{Inverse Optimal Heuristic  Control }(IOHC) which capitalizes on the strengths of both paradigms by  allowing long-horizon, planning style reasoning in a low dimensional space,  while enabling a high dimensional additional set of features to guide overall  action selection.  We frame this combined problem as one of optimization, and  although the resulting objective function is actually non-convex, we are able  to provide convex upper and lower bounds to optimize as surrogates. Further,  these bounds, as well as our empirical results, show that the objective   function is nearly convex and leads to improved performance on a set of  imitation learning problems including turn prediction of drivers as well as  predicting the likely paths taken by pedestrians in an office environment.},
