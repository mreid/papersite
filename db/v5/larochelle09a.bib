  abstract = {We investigate a simple yet effective method to introduce inhibitory and  excitatory interactions between units in the layers of a deep neural  network classifier. The method is based on the greedy layer-wise procedure  of deep learning algorithms and extends the denoising autoencoder of  Vincent~et~al.~\cite{VincentPLarochelleH2008-small} by adding asymmetric  lateral connections between its hidden coding units, in a manner that is much simpler and  computationally more efficient than previously proposed approaches.We  present experiments on two character recognition problems which show for  the first time that lateral connections can significantly improve the  classification performance of deep networks.},
