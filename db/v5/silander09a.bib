  abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic approach for predictive modeling    with Bayesian networks.  Our approach is based on the minimax    optimal Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) distribution, motivated    by the MDL principle. In particular, we present a parameter learning    method which, together with a previously introduced NML-based model    selection criterion, provides a way to construct highly predictive    Bayesian network models from data. The method is parameter-free and    robust, unlike the currently popular Bayesian marginal likelihood    approach which has been shown to be sensitive to the choice of prior    hyperparameters. Empirical tests show that the proposed method    compares favorably with the Bayesian approach in predictive tasks.},
