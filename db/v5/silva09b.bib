  abstract = {Marginal independence constraints play an important role in learning  with graphical models. One way of parameterizing a model of marginal  independencies is by building a latent variable model where two  independent observed variables have no common latent source. In sparse  domains, however, it might be advantageous to model the marginal  observed distribution directly, without explicitly including latent  variables in the model. There have been recent advances in Gaussian  and binary models of marginal independence, but no models with  non-linear dependencies between continuous variables has been proposed  so far. In this paper, we describe how to generalize the Gaussian  model of marginal independencies based on mixtures, and how to learn  parameters. This requires a non-standard parameterization and raises  difficult non-linear optimization issues.},
