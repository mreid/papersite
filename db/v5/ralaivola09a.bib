  abstract = {Pac-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate    generalization bounds for classifiers learned with IID data, and it    is particularly so for margin classifiers.  However, there are many    practical cases where the training data show some dependencies and    where the traditional IID assumption does not apply. Stating    generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost    interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints.  In this    work, we propose the first --~to the best of our knowledge~--    \pac-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data    exhibiting dependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our    results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency    graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of    independent data, through the tool of graph fractional covers.  Our    bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on    the (fractional) chromatic number of the dependency graph is    sufficient to get new \pac-Bayes bounds for specific settings.  We    show how our results can be used to derive bounds for bipartite    ranking and windowed prediction on sequential data.},
