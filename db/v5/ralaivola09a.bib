  title = {Chromatic PAC-Bayes Bounds for Non-IID Data},
  abstract = {Pac-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate  generalization bounds for classifiers learned with IID data, and it  is particularly so for margin classifiers. However, there are many  practical cases where the training data show some dependencies and  where the traditional IID assumption does not apply. Stating  generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost  interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this  work, we propose the first --~to the best of our knowledge~--  \pac-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data  exhibiting dependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our  results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency  graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of  independent data, through the tool of graph fractional covers. Our  bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on  the (fractional) chromatic number of the dependency graph is  sufficient to get new \pac-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We  show how our results can be used to derive bounds for bipartite  ranking and windowed prediction on sequential data.},
