  abstract = {Feature Filters are among the simplest and  fastest approaches to feature selection. A ``filter''  defines a statistical criterion, used to rank  features on how useful they are expected to  be for classification. The highest ranking features  are retained, and the lowest ranking can  be discarded.  A common approach is to use  the Mutual Information between the features  and class label. This area has seen a recent  flurry of activity, resulting in a confusing variety  of heuristic criteria all based on mutual  information, and a lack of a principled way  to understand or relate them. The contribution  of this paper is a unifying theoretical  understanding of such filters. In contrast to current  methods which manually construct filter criteria  with particular properties, we show how  to naturally derive a space of possible ranking  criteria. We will show that several recent  contributions in the feature selection literature  are points within this space, and that  there exist many points that have never been  explored.},
