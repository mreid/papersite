  title = {Optimizing Costly Functions with Simple Constraints: A Limited-Memory Projected Quasi-Newton Algorithm},
  abstract = {An optimization algorithm for minimizing a smooth function over a  convex set is described. Each iteration of the method computes a  descent direction by minimizing, over the original constraints, a  diagonal plus low-rank quadratic approximation to the function. The  quadratic approximation is constructed using a limited-memory  quasi-Newton update. The method is suitable for large-scale  problems where evaluation of the function is substantially more  expensive than projection onto the constraint set. Numerical  experiments on one-norm regularized test problems indicate that the  proposed method is competitive with state-of-the-art methods such as  bound-constrained L-BFGS and orthant-wise descent. We further show  that the method generalizes to a wide class of problems, and   substantially improves on state-of-the-art methods for problems such  as learning the structure of Gaussian graphical models and Markov random  fields.},
