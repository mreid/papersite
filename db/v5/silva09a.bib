  abstract = {Applications of copula models have been increasing in number in recent  years. This class of models provides a modular parameterization of  joint distributions: the specification of the marginal distributions  is parameterized separately from the dependence structure of the  joint, a convenient way of encoding a model for domains such as  finance. Some recent advances on how to specify copulas for arbitrary  dimensions have been proposed, by means of mixtures of decomposable  graphical models. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach for  dealing with mixtures of copulas which, due to the lack of prior  conjugacy, raise computational challenges. We motivate and present  families of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposals that exploit the  particular structure of mixtures of copulas. Different algorithms are  evaluated according to their mixing properties, and an application in  financial forecasting with missing data illustrates the usefulness of  the methodology.},
