  abstract = {Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a popular technique in a
	variety of fields due to its component-based representation with
	physical interpretablity. NMF finds a nonnegative hidden structures
	as oblique bases and coefficients. Recently, Orthogonal NMF (ONMF),
	imposing an orthogonal constraint into NMF, has been gathering a
	great deal of attention. ONMF is more appropriate for the clustering
	task because the resultant constrained matrix consisting of the coefficients
	can be considered as an indicator matrix. All traditional ONMF algorithms
	are based on multiplicative update rules or project gradient descent
	method. However, these algorithms are slow in convergence compared
	with the state-of-the-art algorithms used for regular NMF. This is
	because they update a matrix in each iteration step. In this paper,
	therefore, we propose to update the current matrix column-wisely
	using Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares algorithm (HALS) that
	is typically used for NMF. The orthogonality and nonnegativity constraints
	are both utilized efficiently in the column-wise update procedure.
	Through theoretical analysis and experiments on six real-life datasets,
	it was shown that the proposed algorithm converges faster than the
	other conventional ONMF algorithms due to a smaller number of iterations,
	although the theoretical complexity is the same. It was also shown
	that the orthogonality is also attained in an earlier stage.},
