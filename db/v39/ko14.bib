  pages = {330-343},
  abstract = {Bilinear models of count data with Poisson distribution are popular
	in applications such as matrix factorization for recommendation systems,
	modeling of receptive fields of sensory neurons, and modeling of
	neural-spike trains. Bayesian inference in such models remains challenging
	due to the product term of two Gaussian random vectors. In this paper,
	we propose new algorithms for such models based on variational Gaussian
	(VG) inference. We make two contributions. First, we show that the
	VG lower bound for these models, previously known to be intractable,
	is available in closed form under certain non-trivial constraints
	on the form of the posterior. Second, we show that the lower bound
	is bi- concave and can be efficiently optimized for mean-field approximations.
	We also show that bi-concavity generalizes to the larger family of
	log-concave likelihoods that subsume the Poisson distribution. We
	present new inference algorithms based on these results and demonstrate
	better performance on real-world problems at the cost of a modest
	increase in computation. Our contributions in this paper, therefore,
	provide more choices for Bayesian inference in terms of a speed-vs-accuracy
	tradeoff.},
