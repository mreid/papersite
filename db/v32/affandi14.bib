  abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are  well-suited for modeling repulsion and have  proven useful in applications where diversity  is desired. While DPPs have many appealing  properties, learning the parameters of a DPP  is diffcult, as the likelihood is non-convex  and is infeasible to compute in many scenarios.  Here we propose Bayesian methods for  learning the DPP kernel parameters. These  methods are applicable in large-scale discrete  and continuous DPP settings, even when the  likelihood can only be bounded. We demonstrate  the utility of our DPP learning methods  in studying the progression of diabetic neuropathy  based on the spatial distribution of  nerve fibers, and in studying human perception  of diversity in images.},
