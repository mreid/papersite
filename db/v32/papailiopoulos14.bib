  abstract = {Given a graph, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (\DkS) problem asks for the subgraph on $k$ vertices that contains the largest number of edges. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm for \DkS{} that searches a low-dimensional space for provably good solutions.  We obtain provable performance bounds that depend on the graph spectrum.  One of our results is that if there exists a $k$-subgraph that contains a constant fraction of all the edges, we can approximate \DkS{} within a factor arbitrarily close to two in polynomial time.     Our algorithm runs in nearly linear time, under spectral assumptions satisfied by   most graphs found in applications. Moreover, it is highly scalable and parallelizable.  We demonstrate this by implementing it in MapReduce and executing numerous experiments on  massive real-world graphs that have up to billions of edges.  We empirically show that our algorithm can find subgraphs of significantly higher density compared to the previous state of the art.},
