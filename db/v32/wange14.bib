  abstract = {We study a novel spline-like basis, which we name the   {\it falling factorial basis}, bearing many similarities to the  classic truncated power basis.  The advantage of the falling factorial  basis is that it enables rapid, linear-time computations in basis  matrix multiplication and basis matrix inversion.  The falling  factorial functions are not actually splines, but are close enough  to splines that they provably retain some of the favorable properties  of the latter functions.  We examine their application in two  problems: trend filtering over arbitrary input points, and a  higher-order variant of the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.},
