  abstract = {We introduce a novel algorithmic approach to content recommendation based on adaptive clustering of exploration-exploitation (``bandit") strategies. We provide a sharp regret analysis of this algorithm in a standard stochastic noise setting, demonstrate its scalability properties, and prove its effectiveness on a number of artificial and real-world datasets. Our experiments show a significant increase in prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for bandit problems.},
