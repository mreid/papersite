  abstract = {We develop an efficient algorithm to learn a Mahalanobis distance metric by directly optimizing a ranking loss.  Our approach focuses on optimizing the top of the induced rankings, which is desirable in tasks such as visualization and nearest-neighbor retrieval.  We further develop and justify a simple technique to reduce training time significantly with minimal impact on performance.   Our proposed method significantly outperforms alternative methods on several real-world tasks, and can scale to large and high-dimensional data.},
