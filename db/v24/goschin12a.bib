  abstract = {In some decision-making environments, successful solutions are common. If the evaluation of candidate solutions is noisy, however, the challenge is knowing when a ``good enough'' answer has been found. We formalize this problem as an infinite-armed bandit and provide upper and lower bounds on the number of evaluations or ``pulls'' needed to identify a solution whose evaluation exceeds a given threshold r0 . We present several algorithms and use them to identify reliable strategies for solving screens from the video games \emph{Infinite Mario} and \emph{Pitfall}! We show order of magnitude improvements in sample complexity over a natural approach that pulls each arm until a good estimate of its success probability is known.},
