  abstract = {Concerned with multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL), this paper presents MO-MCTS, an extension of Monte-Carlo Tree Search to multi-objective sequential decision making. The known multi-objective indicator referred to as hyper-volume indicator is used to define an action selection criterion, replacing the UCB criterion in order to deal with multi-dimensional rewards. MO-MCTS is firstly compared with an existing MORL algorithm on the artificial Deep Sea Treasure problem. Then a scalability study of MO-MCTS is made on the NP-hard problem of grid scheduling, showing that the performance of MO-MCTS matches the non RL-based state of the art albeit with a higher computational cost.},
