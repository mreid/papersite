  abstract = {We consider the problem of learning sparsely used overcomplete
dictionaries, where each observation is  a sparse combination of elements from
an unknown overcomplete dictionary. We establish exact recovery when the dictionary
elements are mutually incoherent. Our method consists of a clustering-based initialization
step, which provides an approximate estimate   of the true dictionary with guaranteed
accuracy. This estimate is then refined via an iterative algorithm with the following
alternating steps: 1) estimation of the dictionary coefficients for
each observation through $\ell_1$ minimization, given the dictionary
estimate, and 2) estimation of the dictionary elements through least
squares, given the coefficient estimates. We establish that, under a
set of sufficient conditions, our method converges at a linear rate to
the true dictionary as well as the true coefficients for each
observation.},
