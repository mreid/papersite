  abstract = {This paper studies labeled sample compression for multi-label concept classes. For a specific extension of the notion of VC-dimension to multi-label classes, we prove that every maximum multi-label class of dimension $d$ has a sample compression scheme in which every sample is compressed to a subset of size at most $d$. We further show that every multi-label class of dimension $1$ has a sample compression scheme using only sets of size at most $1$. As opposed to the binary case, the latter result is not immediately implied by the former, since there are multi-label concept classes of dimension $1$ that are not contained in maximum classes of dimension $1$.},
