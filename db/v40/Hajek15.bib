  abstract = {This paper studies the problem of detecting the presence of a small dense community planted in a large Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\calG(N,q)$, where the edge probability within the community exceeds $q$ by a constant factor.
Assuming the hardness of the planted clique detection problem, we show that the  computational  complexity of detecting the community exhibits the following phase transition phenomenon: As the graph size $N$ grows and the graph becomes sparser according to $q=N^{-\alpha}$,
there exists a critical value of $\alpha = \frac{2}{3}$, below which there exists a computationally intensive procedure that can detect far smaller communities than any computationally efficient procedure,
and above which a linear-time procedure is statistically optimal. The results also lead to the average-case hardness results for recovering the dense community and approximating the densest $K$-subgraph.
