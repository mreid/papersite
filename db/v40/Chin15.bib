  abstract = {In this paper, we present  and analyze  a simple  and robust  spectral algorithm
for the stochastic block model with $k$ blocks, for any $k$ fixed.  Our algorithm works with graphs having constant edge density,
under an optimal condition on the gap between the density inside a block and the density between the blocks.
As a co-product, we settle an open question posed by Abbe et. al. concerning  censor block models.},
