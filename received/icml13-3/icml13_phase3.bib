abstract = {Direct policy search can effectively scale to high-dimensional systems, but complex policies with hundreds of parameters often present a challenge for such methods, requiring numerous samples and often falling into poor local optima. We present a guided policy search algorithm that uses trajectory optimization to direct policy learning and avoid poor local optima. We show how differential dynamic programming can be used to generate suitable guiding samples, and describe a regularized importance sampled policy optimization that incorporates these samples into the policy search. We evaluate the method by learning neural network controllers for planar swimming, hopping, and walking, as well as simulated 3D humanoid running.}

Furthermore, novel generalization error bounds are derived. Experiments show SMIR compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {The multi-armed bandit problem has attracted remarkable attention in the machine learning community and many efficient algorithms have been proposed to handle the so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma in various bandit setups. At the same time, significantly less effort has been devoted to adapting bandit algorithms to particular architectures, such as sensor networks, multi-core machines, or peer-to-peer (P2P) environments, which could potentially speed up their convergence. Our goal is to adapt stochastic bandit algorithms to P2P networks.  In our setup, the same set of arms is available in each peer. In every iteration each peer can pull one arm independently of the other peers, and then some limited communication is possible with a few random other peers.  As our main result, we show that our adaptation achieves a linear speedup in terms of the number of peers participating in the network.  More precisely, we show that the probability of playing a suboptimal arm at a peer in iteration $t = \Omega( \log N )$ is proportional to $1/(Nt)$ where $N$ denotes the number of peers.  The theoretical results are supported by simulation experiments showing that our algorithm scales gracefully with the size of network.  }

abstract = {As the sheer volume of available benchmark datasets increases, the problem of joint learning of classifiers and knowledge-transfer between classifiers, becomes more and more relevant. We present a hierarchical approach which exploits information sharing among different classification tasks, in multi-task and multi-class settings. It engages a top-down iterative method, which begins by posing an optimization problem with an incentive for large scale sharing among all classes. This incentive to share is gradually decreased,until there is no sharing and all tasks are considered separately. The method therefore exploits different levels of sharing within a given group of related tasks, without having to make hard decisions about the grouping of tasks. In order to deal with large scale problems, with many tasks and many classes, we extend our batch approach to an online setting and provide regret analysis of the algorithm. We tested our approach extensively on synthetic and real datasets, showing significant improvement over baseline and state-of-the-art methods.}

abstract = {In real crowdsourcing applications, each label from a crowd usually comes  with a certain cost. Given a pre- fixed amount of budget, since different tasks have different ambiguities and different workers have different expertises, we want to  find an optimal way to allocate the budget among instance-worker pairs such that the overall label quality can be maximized. To address this issue, we start from the simplest setting in which all workers are assumed to be perfect. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, one can obtain the optimal allocation policy for a given budget. However,  DP is computationally intractable. To solve the computational challenge, we propose a novel approximate policy which is called optimistic knowledge gradient. It is practically efficient while theoretically its consistency can be guaranteed.  We then extend  the MDP framework to deal with inhomogeneous workers and tasks with contextual information available.  The experiments on both simulated and real data  demonstrate the superiority of our method.}

The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating multi-attribute graphs. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features.  Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions.}

author = {Zhang, Dan and He, Jingrui and Si, Luo and Lawrence, Richard},
pages = {82-90},
abstract = {Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) methods generally represent each example as a collection of  instances such that the features for local objects can be better captured, whereas traditional learning methods typically extract a global feature vector for each example as an integral part. However, there is limited research work on which of the two learning scenarios performs better. This paper proposes a novel framework -- \emph{Multiple Instance LEArning with  Global Embedding (MILEAGE)}, in which  the global feature vectors for traditional learning methods are integrated into the MIL setting.  MILEAGE can leverage the benefits derived from both learning settings. Within the proposed framework, a large margin method is formulated. In particular,  the proposed method adaptively  tunes the weights on the two different kinds of feature  representations (i.e., global and multiple instance) for each example and trains the classifier simultaneously. An alternative algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem, which extends the bundle method to the non-convex case. Some important properties of the proposed method, such as the convergence rate and the generalization error rate, are analyzed. A series of  experiments  have been conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art multiple instance and traditional learning methods.}

abstract = {We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a  measurement matrix $\Phi\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times p}$ and a noisy  observation vector $c\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ constructed from $c =  \Phi\theta^* + \epsilon$ where $\epsilon\in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the  noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian  distribution, how to recover the signal $\theta^*$ if $D\theta^*$ is  sparse {\rca under a linear transformation} $D\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times  p}$? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the  following problem: $$\min_{\theta}~{1\over 2}\|\Phi\theta - c\|^2 +  \lambda\|D\theta\|_1.$$ This paper provides an upper bound of the  estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by  assuming that the design matrix $\Phi$ is a Gaussian random matrix.  Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition  number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement number $n\geq  \Omega(s\log(p))$ where $s$ is the sparsity number, then the true  solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy  case, if the condition number of $D$ is bounded and the measurement  increases faster than $s\log(p)$, that is, $s\log(p)=o(n)$, the  estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when $p$ and $s$  go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the  special case $D=\bold{I}_{p\times p}$ (equivalently LASSO) and  improve the existing analysis. The condition number of $D$ plays a  critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in  two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the  condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant,  while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with  high probability if $m\over p$ (i.e., $\#\text{edge}\over  \#\text{vertex}$) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical  simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.}

abstract = {The ranking of $n$ objects based on pairwise comparisons is a core machine learning problem, arising in recommender systems, ad placement, player ranking, biological applications and others. In many practical situations the true pairwise comparisons cannot be actively measured, but a subset of all $n(n-1)/2$ comparisons is passively and noisily observed. Optimization algorithms (e.g., the SVM) could be used to predict a ranking with fixed expected Kendall tau distance, while achieving an $\Omega(n)$ lower bound on the corresponding sample complexity. However, due to their centralized structure they are difficult to extend to online or distributed settings. In this paper we show that much simpler algorithms can match the same $\Omega(n)$ lower bound in expectation. Furthermore, if an average of $O(n\log(n))$ binary comparisons are measured, then one algorithm recovers the true ranking in a uniform sense, while the other predicts the ranking more accurately near the top than the bottom. We discuss extensions to online and distributed ranking, with benefits over traditional alternatives.  }

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of differentially private learning where access to the training features is through a kernel function only. Existing work on this problem is restricted to translation invariant kernels only, where (approximate) training features are available explicitly.  In fact, for general class of kernel functions and in general setting of releasing different private predictor ($\w^*$), the problem is impossible to solve \cite{CMS11}. In this work, we relax the problem setting into three different easier but practical settings. In our first problem setting, we consider an interactive model where the user sends its test set to a trusted learner who sends back differentially private predictions over the test points. This setting is prevalent in modern online systems like search engines, ad engines etc. In the second model, the learner sends back a differentially private version of the optimal parameter vector $\w^*$ but requires access to a small subset of unlabeled test set beforehand. This also is a practical setting that involves two parties interacting through trusted third party. Our third model is similar to the traditional model, where learner is oblivious to the test set and needs to send a differentially private version of $\w^*$, but the kernels are restricted to efficiently computable functions over low-dimensional vector spaces. For each of the models, we derive differentially private learning algorithms with provable ``utlity'' or error bounds. Moreover, we  show that our methods can also be applied to the traditional setting of \cite{ Rubinstein09, CMS11}. Here, our sample complexity bounds have only $O(d^{1/3})$ dependence on the dimensionality $d$ while existing methods require $O(d^{1/2})$ samples to achieve same generalization error.}

abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state of the art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied version of the contextual bandits problem. We prove a high probability regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\sqrt{\epsilon}}\sqrt{T^{1+\epsilon}})$ in time $T$ for any $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, where $d$ is the dimension of each context vector and $\epsilon$ is a parameter used by the algorithm. Our results provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling, and are close to the lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ for this problem. This essentially solves the COLT open problem of Chapelle and Li [COLT 2012] regarding regret bounds for Thompson Sampling for contextual bandits problem with linear payoff functions.     Our version of Thompson sampling uses Gaussian prior and Gaussian likelihood function. Our novel martingale-based analysis techniques also allow easy extensions to the use of other distributions, satisfying certain general conditions.   }

We show that for linear models, e.g potential functions generated by linear combinations of a large number of features, it is possible to compute analytically the marginal of the observations and derive an efficient sampler. The method is evaluated using robot behaviors and real data from human motion and compared to other techniques.  }

We present efficient algorithms for the three standard inference tasks in a CRF, namely  computing (i) the partition function, (ii) marginals, and (iii) computing the MAP.  Their complexities are respectively  $O(n L)$, $O(n L \ell_{\max})$ and  $O(n L \min\{|D|,\log (\ell_{\max}\!+\!1)\})$  where $L$ is the combined length of input patterns, $\ell_{\max}$ is the maximum length of a pattern,  and $D$ is the input alphabet.  This improves on the previous algorithms of~\cite{Ye:NIPS09} whose complexities are respectively $O(n L |D|)$,  $O\left(n |\Gamma| L^2 \ell_{\max}^2\right)$ and $O(n L |D|)$,  where $|\Gamma|$ is the number of input patterns.

This is an important problem in the signal acquisition area and has several learning applications as well, e.g., multi-label classification \cite{HsuKLZ10}. We study this problem in two settings: a) support recovery: recover $\supp(\x^*)$, b) approximate vector recovery: recover a unit vector $\hx$ s.t. $|| \hat{x}-\x^*/||\x^*|| ||_2\leq \epsilon$. For support recovery, we propose two novel and efficient solutions based on two combinatorial structures: union free family of sets and expanders. In contrast to  existing methods for  support recovery, our methods are universal i.e. a single measurement matrix $A$ can recover almost all the signals. For approximate recovery, we propose the first  method to recover sparse vector using a near optimal number of measurements.  We also empirically demonstrate  effectiveness of our algorithms; we show that our algorithms are able to recover signals with smaller number of measurements than several existing methods. }

abstract = {Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) is a popular method for  learning a distance metric to be used within a k-nearest neighbors  (kNN) classifier.    A key assumption built into the model is that each point  stochastically selects a single neighbor, which  makes the model well-justified only for kNN with k=1.  However, kNN classifiers with k>1 are more robust and usually   preferred in practice.     Here we present kNCA, which generalizes NCA by  learning distance metrics that are appropriate for  kNN with arbitrary k.  The main technical contribution is showing  how to efficiently compute and optimize the expected  accuracy of a kNN classifier.  We apply similar ideas in an unsupervised  setting to yield kSNE and ktSNE, generalizations of  Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE, tSNE) that operate on  neighborhoods of size k, which provide an axis of control over  embeddings that allow for more homogeneous and interpretable regions.  Empirically, we show that kNCA often improves classification accuracy over  state of the art methods, produces qualitative  differences in the embeddings as k is varied, and is more robust with  respect to label noise. }

author = {Bryan, Nicholas and Mysore, Gautham},
pages = {208-216},
abstract = {In applications such as audio denoising, music transcription, music remixing, and audio-based forensics, it is desirable to decompose a single-channel recording into its respective sources.  One of the current most effective class of methods to do so is based on non-negative matrix factorization and related latent variable models.  Such techniques, however, typically perform poorly when no isolated training data is given and do not allow user feedback to correct for poor results. To overcome these issues, we allow a user to interactively constrain a latent variable model by painting on a time-frequency display of sound to guide the learning process.  The annotations are used within the framework of posterior regularization to impose linear grouping constraints that would otherwise be difficult to achieve via standard priors.  For the constraints considered, an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is derived with closed-form multiplicative updates, drawing connections to non-negative matrix factorization methods, and allowing for high-quality interactive-rate separation without explicit training data.}

author = {Lopes, Miles},
pages = {217-225},
abstract = {In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity $\|x\|_0$ of the unknown signal $x\in\R^p$ is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of  CS depend on knowing $\|x\|_0$, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that $\|x\|_0$ is a highly unstable function of $x$. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value $\|x\|_0=p$ is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity $s(x):=\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2$, which is a sharp lower bound on $\|x\|_0$. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A confidence interval for $s(x)$ is  provided, and its width is shown to have no dependence on the signal dimension $p$. Moreover, this result extends naturally to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be estimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of randomized measurements is essential to estimating $s(x)$. This is accomplished by proving that the minimax risk for estimating $s(x)$ with deterministic measurements is large when $n\ll p$.}

Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.}

This simultaneously optimizes the data likelihood and therefore partly maintains the generative character of the model.  For many network structures, our method can be formulated as a convex problem, guaranteeing a globally optimal solution.  In terms of classification, the resulting models outperform state-of-the art generative and discriminative learning methods for Bayesian networks, and are comparable with linear and kernelized SVMs.  Furthermore, the models achieve likelihoods close to the maximum likelihood solution and show robust behavior in classification experiments with missing features.}

Recently, there has been much interest in developing frameworks that combine both transfer and active learning  methodologies. A few such frameworks reported in literature perform transfer and active learning in two separate stages. In this work, we present an integrated framework that performs transfer and active learning simultaneously by solving a  single convex optimization problem. The proposed framework computes the weights of source domain data and selects the samples from the target domain data simultaneously, by minimizing a common objective of reducing distribution difference between the data set consisting of reweighted source and the queried target domain data and the set of unlabeled target domain data. Comprehensive experiments on three real world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 5% to  10% over the existing two-stage approach}

As a generalization of belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP) approximates exact Bayesian computation with efficient message passing updates. However, when an approximation family used by EP is far from exact posterior distributions, message passing may lead to poor approximation quality and suffer from divergence. To address this issue, we propose an  approximate inference method, relaxed expectation propagation(REP), based on a new divergence with a l1 penalty. Minimizing this penalized divergence adaptively relaxes EP's moment matching requirement for message passing. We apply REP to Gaussian process classification and experimental results demonstrate significant improvement of REP over EP and alpha-divergence based power EP -- in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation accuracy, and predictive performance. Furthermore, we develop relaxed belief propagation(RBP), a special case of REP, to conduct inference on discrete Markov random fields (MRFs). Our results show improved estimation accuracy of RBP over BP and fractional BP when interactions between MRF nodes are strong.}

We present a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that instead works in a top-down manner, mimicking the behavior and speed of classic algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our approach delivers accuracy comparable to the most popular MCMC method, but operates more than an order of magnitude faster, and thus represents a better computation-accuracy tradeoff.}

To address this, we propose a novel robust and discriminative self-taught learning approach to utilize any unlabeled data without the above restrictions. Our new approach employs a robust loss function to learn the dictionary, and enforces the structured sparse regularization to automatically select the optimal dictionary basis vectors and incorporate the supervision information contained in the labeled data. We derive an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem and rigorously prove its convergence. Promising results in extensive experiments have validated the proposed approach.}

To address this issue, we consider safe policy improvements, i.e., at each iteration we search for a policy that maximizes a lower bound to the policy improvement w.r.t. the current policy. When no improving policy can be found the algorithm stops.  We propose two safe policy-iteration algorithms that differ in the way the next policy is chosen w.r.t. the estimated greedy policy.  Besides being theoretically derived and discussed, the proposed algorithms are empirically evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art approaches on some chain-walk domains and on the Blackjack card game.}

The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a nuclear norm based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives. In a real world stock dataset, it also discovers meaningful groupings of variables, and produces a model that fits the data better.}

Exploiting these properties, we derive an optimization problem for estimating the parameters of a latent tree graphical model, i.e., hierarchical decomposion of a tensor which minimizes the Frobenius norm of the difference between the original tensor and its decomposition.    When the latent tree graphical models are correctly specified, we show that a global optimum of the optimization problem can be obtained via a recursive decomposition algorithm. This algorithm recovers previous spectral algorithms for hidden Markov models (Hsu et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2012) and latent tree graphical models (Parikh et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011) as special cases, elucidating the global objective these algorithms are optimizing for. When the latent tree graphical models are misspecified, we derive a better decomposition based on our framework, and provide approximation guarantee for this new estimator. In both synthetic and real world data, this new estimator significantly improves over the-state-of-the-art.}

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification.

This new backup, which we call a small backup, opens the door to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning methods that exhibit much finer control over their planning process than traditional methods. We empirically demonstrate that this increased flexibility allows for more efficient planning by showing that an implementation of prioritized sweeping based on small backups achieves a substantial performance improvement over classical implementations. }

The representation is iteratively refined as part of a novel Value Iteration step and does not depend on prior knowledge. Consistency for the learned generalization is asserted by a self-correction algorithm.

A general principle to solve the problem is to make the training data distribution similar to the test one, such that classifiers computed on the former generalizes well to the latter. Current approaches typically target on the sample distribution in the input space, however, for kernel-based learning methods, the algorithm performance depends directly on the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this, we propose to match data distributions in the Hilbert space, which, given a pre-defined empirical kernel map, can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. In particular, to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples, the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercers theorem. Our approach caters the model adaptation specifically to kernel-based learning mechanism, and demonstrates promising results on several real-world applications.}

However, in many real-world applications, the number of class labels can be in the hundreds or even thousands, and existing multi-label classification methods often become computationally inefficient. In recent years, a number of remedies have been proposed. However, they are either based on simple dimension reduction techniques or involve expensive optimization problems. In this paper, we address this problem by selecting a small subset of class labels that can approximately span the original label space. This is performed by randomized sampling where the sampling probability of each class label reflects its importance among all the labels. Theoretical analysis shows that this randomized sampling approach is highly efficient. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-label datasets with many labels demonstrate the appealing performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  }

abstract = {The paper studies the problem of recovering a spectrally sparse object from a small number of time domain samples. Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension $n$ is assumed to be a mixture of $r$ complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the {\em basis mismatch} issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem,  we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by converting the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of $\mathcal{O}(r\log^{2} n)$. We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments.  }

In particular, we first introduce the Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian (MGIG) prior and define a Gaussian Matrix Generalized Inverse Gaussian (GMGIG) model for low-rank approximation to the task covariance matrix. Through combining the GMGIG model with the residual error structure assumption, we propose the GMGIG regression model for multi-task learning. To make the computation tractable, we simultaneously use variational inference and sampling techniques. In particular, we propose two sampling strategies for computing the statistics of the MGIG distribution. Experiments show that this model is superior to the peer methods in regression and prediction.}

abstract = {Recently Burger et al. (2012) and Xie et al. (2012) proposed to use a denoising autoencoder (DAE) for denoising noisy images. They showed that a plain, deep DAE can denoise noisy images as well as the conventional methods such as BM3D and KSVD. Both of them approached image denoising by denoising small, image patches of a larger image and combining them to form a clean image. In this setting, it is usual to use the encoder of the DAE to obtain the latent representation and subsequently apply the decoder to get the clean patch. We propose that a simple sparsification of the latent representation found by the encoder improves denoising performance, when the DAE was trained with sparsity regularization. The experiments confirm that the proposed sparsification indeed helps both denoising a small image patch and denoising a larger image consisting of those patches. Furthermore, it is found out that the proposed method improves even classification performance when test samples are corrupted with noise.}

This gives very good affinities that adapt locally to the data but are harder to compute. We study the mathematical properties of these ``entropic affinities'' and show that they implicitly define a continuously differentiable function in the input space and give bounds for it. We then devise a fast algorithm to compute the widths and affinities, based on robustified, quickly convergent root-finding methods combined with a tree- or density-based initialization scheme that exploits the slowly-varying behavior of this function. This algorithm is nearly optimal and much more accurate and fast than the existing bisection-based approach, particularly with large datasets, as we show with image and text data.}

We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and efficiently scale to problems with over half a million training points. Experiments on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification accuracy as compared to RBF-SVMs. Furthermore, our formulation leads to much better classification accuracies over leading methods.}

All parameters are estimated jointly, thus capturing dependencies between them. We show that gradients of a variety of loss functions over the mean field marginals can be computed efficiently. The resulting algorithm learns parameters that directly optimize the performance of mean field inference in the model.  As a supporting result, we present an efficient inference algorithm for dense random fields that is guaranteed to converge.}

Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead of computing point estimates. Changes in market conditions are captured by assuming a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally computationally efficient and scalable inference is performed using particle filters. Experiments with financial data show excellent performance of the proposed method with respect to current standard models.}

It is well known that the usual misclassification error is ill-suited for measuring performance in such settings. A wide range of performance measures have been proposed for this problem, in machine learning as well as in data mining, artificial intelligence, and various applied fields. However, despite the large number of studies on this problem, little is understood about the statistical consistency of the algorithms proposed with respect to the performance measures of interest. In this paper, we study consistency with respect to one such performance measure, namely the arithmetic mean of the true positive and true negative rates (AM), and establish that some simple methods that have been used in practice, such as applying an empirically determined threshold to a suitable class probability estimate or performing an empirically balanced form of risk minimization, are in fact consistent with respect to the AM (under mild conditions on the underlying distribution). Our results employ balanced losses that have been used recently in analyses of ranking problems (Kotlowski et al., 2011) and build on recent results on consistent surrogates for cost-sensitive losses (Scott, 2012). Experimental results confirm our consistency theorems.  }

Although many online learning algorithms have been proposed to learn a sparse kernel classifier, most of them fail to bound the number of support vectors used by the final solution which is the average of the intermediate kernel classifiers generated by online algorithms. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to measure the difficulty in correctly classifying a training example by the derivative of a smooth loss function, and give a more chance to a difficult example to be a support vector than an easy one via a sampling scheme. Our analysis shows that when the loss function is smooth, the proposed algorithm yields similar performance guarantee as the standard online learning algorithm but with a near optimal number of support vectors (up to a poly(lnT) factor). Our empirical study shows promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for online sparse kernel learning.}

abstract = {In multi-class categorization tasks, knowledge about the classes' semantic relationships can provide valuable information beyond the class labels themselves.  However, existing techniques focus on preserving the semantic distances between classes (e.g., according to a given object taxonomy for visual recognition), limiting the influence to pairwise structures.  We propose to model \emph{analogies} that reflect the relationships between multiple pairs of classes simultaneously, in the form ``$p$ is to $q$, as $r$ is to $s$"".  We translate semantic analogies into higher-order geometric constraints called \emph{analogical parallelograms}, and use them in a novel convex regularizer for a discriminatively learned label embedding.   Furthermore, we show how to discover analogies from attribute-based class descriptions, and how to prioritize those likely to reduce inter-class confusion.  Evaluating our Analogy-preserving Semantic Embedding (ASE) on two visual recognition datasets, we demonstrate clear improvements over existing approaches, both in terms of recognition accuracy and analogy completion.  }

But not all classifiers have an obvious structure, so we introduce the Free HomTrainer.  This can be used to give a ``generic'' algebraic structure to any classifier.  We use the Free HomTrainer to give algebraic structure to bagging and boosting.  In so doing, we derive novel online and parallel algorithms, and present the first fast cross-validation schemes for these classifiers.}

abstract = {Multi-task learning is a paradigm shown to improve the performance of related tasks through their joint learning. However, for real-world data, it is usually difficult to assess the task relatedness and joint learning with unrelated tasks may lead to serious performance degradations. To this end, we propose a framework that groups the tasks based on their relatedness in a low dimensional subspace and allows a varying degree of relatedness among tasks by sharing the subspace bases across the groups. This provides the flexibility of no sharing when two sets of tasks are unrelated and partial/total sharing when the tasks are related. Importantly, the number of task-groups and the subspace dimensionality are automatically inferred from the data. This feature keeps the model beyond a specific set of parameters. To realize our framework, we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior that extends the traditional hierarchical beta process prior using a Dirichlet process to permit potentially infinite number of child beta processes. We apply our model for multi-task regression and classification applications. Experimental results using several synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of our model to other recent state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods.}

Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments. We evaluate the performance of our network inference algorithms on large synthetic and real cascade datasets, and show that our models are able to predict the length and duration of cascades in real data.}

Here we extend the LDA model to deal with documents that are represented more naturally by bags of continuous descriptors. Given a finite dictionary of words which are generative models of descriptors, our extended LDA model allows for the soft assignment of descriptors to (many) dictionary words. We derive variational inference and parameter estimation procedures for the extended model, which closely resemble those obtained for the original model, with two important differences: First, the histogram of word counts is replaced by a histogram of pseudo word counts, or sums of responsibilities over all descriptors. Second, parameter estimation now depends on the average covariance matrix between these pseudo-counts, reflecting the fact that with soft assignment words are not independent.    We use this approach to address novelty detection, where we seek to identify video events with low posterior probability. Video events are described by a generative dynamic texture model, from which we naturally derive a dictionary of generative words.  Using a benchmark dataset for novelty detection, we show a very significant improvement in the detection of novel events when using our extended LDA model with soft assignment to words as against hard assignment (the original model), achieving state of the art novelty detection results.}

Scores are commonly computed by using training criteria that relate the autoencoder to a probabilistic model, such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In this paper we show how an autoencoder can assign meaningful scores to data independently of training procedure and without reference to any probabilistic model, by interpreting it as a dynamical system. We discuss how, and under which conditions, running the dynamical system can be viewed as performing gradient descent in an energy function, which in turn allows us to derive a score via integration. We also show how one can combine multiple, unnormalized scores into a generative classifier.}

Appropriate stick-breaking priors are imposed over the component switching  mechanism of our model to allow for data-driven determination of the  optimal number of component large-margin classifiers, under a standard  nonparametric Bayesian inference scheme. Efficient model training  is performed under the maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework,  which integrates the large-margin principle with Bayesian posterior  inference.

With appropriate parameter choices, the estimate is the solution to a sparse, diagonally dominant linear system, solvable in near-linear time.

In this paper, we reason about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures.

Starting with this proposal graph structure, we then design moves to obtain several other likely graph structures. We then show that our approach improves the state-of-the-art significantly for detecting past activities as well as for anticipating future activities, on a dataset of 120 activity videos collected from four subjects.}

Using background knowledge, causal interpretations allow us to determine the correct situation for a problem at hand. We exploit importance reweighting or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by {\it reweighting or transforming training data to reproduce the covariate distribution} on the test domain.

In this paper, we identify a set of natural conditions -- weak dependence, hypothesis complexity and a new measure, collective stability -- that are sufficient for generalization from even a single example, without imposing an explicit generative model of the data. We then demonstrate that the complexity and stability conditions are satisfied by a broad class of models, including marginal inference in templated graphical models. We thus obtain uniform convergence rates that can decrease significantly faster than previous bounds, particularly when each structured example is sufficiently large and the number of training examples is constant, even one.}

However, we show that these algorithms can be unstable and ineffective in real-world settings where biases and noise in the feedback are significant. In this paper, we propose the first coactive learning algorithm that can learn robustly despite bias and noise. In particular, we explore how presenting users with slightly perturbed objects (e.g., rankings) can stabilize the learning process. We theoretically validate the algorithm by proving bounds on the average regret. We also provide extensive empirical evidence on benchmarks and from a live search engine user study, showing that the new algorithm substantially outperforms existing methods.}

The resulting algorithms, which repeatedly compute and then efficiently optimize submodular semigradients, offer new and generalize many old methods for submodular optimization.  Our approach, moreover, takes steps towards providing a unifying paradigm applicable to both submodular minimization and maximization, problems that historically have been treated quite distinctly. The practicality of our algorithms is important since interest in submodularity, owing to its natural and wide applicability, has recently been in ascendance within machine learning.  We analyze theoretical properties of our algorithms for minimization and maximization, and show that many state-of-the-art maximization algorithms are special cases. Lastly, we complement our theoretical analyses with supporting empirical experiments.}

abstract = {We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a fully Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernel functions have been introduced to matrix factorization to integrate side information about the rows and columns (e.g., objects and users in recommender systems), which is necessary for making out-of-matrix (i.e., cold start) predictions. We discuss specifically bipartite graph inference, where the output matrix is binary, but extensions to more general matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A fully conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization problem enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas fully Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning that additionally reveals which side information sources are informative. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. We then show that our framework can also be used for solving multilabel learning problems by considering samples and labels as the two domains where matrix factorization operates on. Our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming loss values on 10 out of 14 multilabel classification data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms.}

An SPN is either a univariate distribution, a product of SPNs over disjoint variables, or a weighted sum of SPNs over the same variables. We propose the first algorithm for learning the structure of SPNs that takes full advantage of their expressiveness. At each step, the algorithm attempts to divide the current variables into approximately independent subsets. If successful, it returns the product of recursive calls on the subsets; otherwise it returns the sum of recursive calls on subsets of similar instances from the current training set. A comprehensive empirical study shows that the learned SPNs are typically comparable to graphical models in likelihood but superior in inference speed and accuracy.}

It can be expressed as a linear program,   and   interior-point methods can be used to find a solution for  moderately large problems.  Dealing with very large problems, \emph{e.g.}, involving data up to and   beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge.  Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in time that is nearly   linear in the size of the input and that, with constant probability,   computes a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile   regression problem.  Our algorithm computes a low-distortion subspace-preserving  embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile regression.  Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is competitive with   the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and that   it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and    applied to terabyte-sized problems.}

Consider, \emph{e.g.}, the $\ell_p$ regression problem: given a matrix   $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and a vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$, find a   vector $x^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ that minimizes $f(x) = \|A x - b\|_p$.

In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for solving strongly   over-determined $(m \gg n)$ robust $\ell_p$ regression problems to moderate precision on   MapReduce.  Our empirical results on data up to the terabyte scale demonstrate   that our algorithm is a significant improvement over traditional iterative algorithms on MapReduce   for $\ell_1$ regression, even for a fairly small number   of iterations.   In addition, our proposed interior-point cutting-plane method can also be   extended to solving more general convex problems on MapReduce.}

It has been demonstrated that a key to successfully find a good (local) solution of S3VM is to gradually increase the effect of unlabeled data, a la annealing. However, existing algorithms suffer from the trade-off between the resolution of annealing steps and the computation cost. In this paper, we go beyond this trade-off by proposing a novel training algorithm that efficiently performs annealing with an infinitesimal resolution. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions with less computation time than existing approaches.  }

We develop a regression-based algorithm which only needs to maintain the first and second order statistics of training data in memory, resulting a storage requirement independent from the size of training data. To efficiently handle high dimensional data, we develop a randomized algorithm that approximates the covariance matrices by low rank matrices. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

As a result, it is imperative to learn online from partial interaction sequences, so that information acquired from one customer is efficiently assimilated and applied in subsequent interactions with other customers. We present the first framework for concurrent reinforcement learning, using a variant of temporal-difference learning to learn efficiently from partial interaction sequences.   We evaluate our algorithms in two large-scale test-beds for online and email interaction respectively, generated from a database of 300,000 customer records. }

In such a chain structure, the order of base learners is critical: better order can lead to less evaluation time.    In this paper, we present a novel method for ordering. We base our discussion on the data structure representing Boosting's decision function. Viewing the decision function a boolean expression, we propose a Binary Valued Tree for its representation. As a secondary contribution, such a representation unifies the work by previous researchers and helps devise new representation. Also, its connection to Binary Decision Diagram(BDD) is discussed.}

We show that the relatedness of source and target domains accelerates the convergence of the Leave-One-Out error to the generalization error, thus enabling the use of the Leave-One-Out error to find the optimal transfer parameters, even in the presence of a small training set. In case of unrelated domains we also suggest a theoretically principled way to prevent negative transfer, so that in the limit we recover the performance of the algorithm not using any knowledge from the source domain.}

abstract = {Latent Gaussian models (LGMs) are widely used in statistics and machine learning.  Bayesian inference in non-conjugate LGM is difficult due to intractable integrals involving the Gaussian prior and non-conjugate likelihoods.  Algorithms based on Variational Gaussian (VG) approximations are widely employed since they strike a favorable balance between accuracy, generality, speed, and ease of use.  However, the structure of optimization problems associated with them    remains poorly understood, and standard solvers take too long to converge.  In this paper, we derive a novel dual variational inference approach, which exploits the convexity property of the VG approximations.   The implications of our approach is that we obtain an algorithm that solves a convex optimization problem, reduces the number of variational parameters, and converges much faster than previous methods.  Using real world data, we demonstrate these advantages on a variety of LGMs including Gaussian process classification and latent Gaussian Markov random fields.    }

abstract = {This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the   presence of  {\em small clusters}. Traditional results dictate that for an   algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\em all} clusters must be   sufficiently large (in particular, $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number   of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined   analysis of the trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in (Jalali et al. 2011) and (Chen et al. 2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assuptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones.  Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm   to recover {\em almost all clusters} via a ``peeling strategy'', i.e., recover large clusters   first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure.   These results are extended to the    {\em partial observation} setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed.  The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which   edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned  (and removed).  Our findings are supported by experiments.    From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimesional statistics and   learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which  a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations  does the job.}

This formulation yields a submodular function of the features that corresponds to a lower bound on the model evidence. By adding a constant to this function, we obtain a nonnegative submodular function that can be maximized via a greedy algorithm that obtains at least a 1/3-approximation to the optimal solution.

We introduce Anytime Feature Representations (AFR), a novel algorithm that explicitly addresses this trade-off in the data representation rather than in the classifier. This enables us to turn conventional classifiers, in particular Support Vector Machines, into test-time cost sensitive anytime classifiers combining the advantages of anytime learning and large-margin classification.}

abstract = {While convex losses for binary classification are attractive due to the existence of numerous (provably) efficient methods for finding their global optima, they are sensitive to outliers.  On the other hand, while the non-convex 0--1 loss is robust to outliers, it is NP-hard to optimize and thus rarely directly optimized in practice.  In this paper, however, we do just that: we explore a variety of practical methods for direct (approximate) optimization of the 0--1 loss based on branch and bound search, combinatorial search, and coordinate descent on smooth, differentiable relaxations of 0--1 loss. Empirically, we compare our proposed algorithms to logistic regression, SVM, and the Bayes point machine showing that the proposed 0--1 loss optimization algorithms perform at least as well and offer a clear advantage in the presence of outliers.  To this end, we believe this work reiterates the importance of 0--1 loss and its robustness properties while challenging the notion that it is difficult to directly optimize.}

However, in contrast to existing approaches, we do not assume that each alternative is characterized by a real-valued random variable, and that samples are taken from the corresponding distributions. Instead, we only assume that alternatives can be compared in terms of pairwise preferences. We propose and formally analyze a general preference-based racing algorithm that we instantiate with three specific ranking procedures and corresponding sampling schemes. Experiments with real and synthetic data are presented to show the efficiency of our approach.}

Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant.  In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.}

When facing complex domains, such as the positive semidefinite cone, the projection operation can be expensive, leading to a high computational cost per iteration. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that aims to reduce the number of projections for stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of several recent developments in stochastic optimization, including mini-batches, extra-gradient, and epoch gradient descent, in order to effectively explore the smoothness and strong convexity. We show, both in expectation and with a high probability, that when the objective function is both smooth and strongly convex, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal O(1/T) rate of convergence with only O(logT) projections. Our empirical study verifies the theoretical result.}

We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.     Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.   }

We further use real values in the visible layer as opposed to multinomial variables, thus taking advantage of the natural order between user-item ratings. Finally, we explore the potential of combining the original training data with data generated by the RBM-based model itself in a bootstrapping fashion. The evaluation on two MovieLens datasets (with 100K and 1M user-item ratings, respectively), shows that our RBM model rivals the best previously-proposed approaches.  }

We predict the true pairs using a likelihood ratio that trades off the entities' similarity with their rarity. This method always outperforms using only similarity; however, with certain parameter settings, similarity turns out to be surprisingly competitive. Using real data, we apply the model to detect twins given their birth weights and to re-identify cell phone users based on distinctive usage patterns.}

This approximation problem is reduced to a regression problem using an adjoint trick, and solved in a vector-valued RKHS, consisting of continuous, linear, smooth operators which map from an input, real-valued RKHS to the desired target RKHS. Important constraints, such as an almost everywhere positive density, can be enforced or approximated naturally in this framework, using convex constraints on the operators. Finally, smooth operators can be composed to accomplish more complex machine learning tasks, such as the sum rule and kernelized approximate Bayesian inference, where state-of-the-art convergence rates are obtained.}

In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA.

In this paper we attempt to improve the understanding of the underlying issues by exploring these problems from an analytical, a geometric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet effective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gradients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem. We validate empirically our hypothesis and proposed solutions in the experimental section.  }

Our system is able to train 1 billion parameter networks on just 3 machines in a couple of days, and we show that it can scale to networks with over 11 billion parameters using just 16 machines.  As this infrastructure is much more easily marshaled by others, the approach enables much wider-spread research with extremely large neural networks.}

The nonparametric nature of our algorithm allows for learning the unknown number of meaningful trajectories. Additionally, we acknowledge the usefulness of expert guidance by providing for their input using must-link and cannot- link constraints. These constraints are encoded with Markov random fields. We also provide an efficient variational approach for performing inference on our model.}

Under certain conditions we show the consistency of these estimators, derive upper bounds on their convergence rates, and show that the estimators do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, when the conditions are less restrictive, we derive a lower bound which proves that in the worst case the convergence can be arbitrarily slow similarly to some other estimators. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of our method.}

We propose a simple, efficient, and provably near-optimal approach to optimizing such prediction problems based on no-regret learning. Our method leverages a surprising result from online submodular optimization: a single no-regret online learner can compete with an optimal sequence of predictions. Compared to previous work, which either learn a sequence of classifiers or rely on stronger assumptions such as realizability, we ensure both data-efficiency as well as performance guarantees in the fully agnostic setting. Experiments validate the efficiency and applicability of the approach on a wide range of problems including manipulator trajectory optimization, news recommendation and document summarization.}

Based on a recently proposed framework so-called safe screening rule, we derive a rule for screening out non-SVs in advance, and discuss how we can exploit the advantage of the rule in pathwise SVM computation scenario. Experiments indicate that our approach often substantially reduce the total pathwise computation cost.}

Previous work has uncovered sufficient and necessary conditions for the consistency of the resulting procedures. In this paper, we strengthen these results by showing how the $0-1$ excess loss of a predictor can be upper bounded as a function of the excess loss of the predictor measured using the convex surrogate. The bound is developed for the case of cost-sensitive multiclass classification and a convex surrogate loss that goes back to the work of  Lee, Lin and Wahba. The bounds are as easy to calculate as in binary classification. Furthermore, we also show that our analysis extends to the analysis of the recently introduced ``Simplex Coding'' scheme.}

abstract = {Many semi-supervised clustering algorithms have been proposed to improve the clustering accuracy by effectively exploring the available side information that is usually in the form of pairwise constraints. Despite the progress, there are two main shortcomings of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms. First, they have to deal with non-convex optimization problems, leading to clustering results that are sensitive to the initialization. Second, none of these algorithms is equipped with theoretical guarantee regarding the clustering performance. We address these limitations by developing a framework for semi-supervised clustering based on {\it input pattern assisted matrix completion}. The key idea is to cast clustering into a matrix completion problem, and solve it efficiently by exploiting the correlation between input patterns and cluster assignments. Our analysis shows that under appropriate conditions, only $O(\log n)$ pairwise constraints are needed to accurately recover the true cluster partition. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it to the state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms on several benchmark datasets.}

abstract = {In this study, we derive algorithms for estimating mixed $\beta$-divergences. Such cost functions are useful for Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Factorization models with a compound Poisson observation model. Compound Poisson is a particular Tweedie model, an important special case of exponential dispersion models characterized by the fact that the variance is proportional to a power function of the mean. There are several well known matrix and tensor factorization algorithms that minimize the $\beta$-divergence; these estimate the mean parameter. The probabilistic interpretation gives us more flexibility and robustness by providing us additional tunable parameters such as power and dispersion. Estimation of the power parameter is useful for choosing a suitable divergence and estimation of dispersion is useful for data driven regularization and weighting in collective/coupled factorization of heterogeneous datasets. We present three inference algorithms for both estimating the factors and the additional parameters of the compound Poisson distribution. The methods are evaluated on two applications: modeling symbolic representations for polyphonic music and lyric prediction from audio features. Our conclusion is that the compound poisson based factorization models can be useful for sparse positive data.}

We observe in numerical experiments that these components are of equal or greater quality than ones obtained from current state-of-the-art techniques, but require between one and two orders of magnitude fewer flops to be computed. Conceptually, our approach generalizes the Rayleigh quotient iteration algorithm for computing eigenvectors, and can be interpreted as a type of second-order optimization method. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms on several datasets, including the STL-10 machine vision dataset and gene expression data.}

Moreover, by decoupling the \emph{structure generating} part of the  process from the components responsible for the observations, we are  able to apply the same statistical approach to a variety of user  generated data.

We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity.}

abstract = {Existing dictionary learning algorithms are based on the  assumption that the data are vectors in an Euclidean vector  space, and the dictionary is learned from the training data using the vector space structure and its Euclidean metric. However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure.  Furthermore, the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that  the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here. We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can  be effectively computed for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical imaging analysis.}
