  author = {Blanchard, Gilles and Scott, Clayton},
  pages = {1-9},
  abstract = {A variety of machine learning problems are characterized by   data sets that are drawn from multiple different convex   combinations of a fixed set of base distributions.  We call this a mutual contamination model.  In such problems, it is often of interest to   recover these base distributions, or otherwise discern   their properties. This work focuses on the problem of   classification with multiclass label noise, in a general   setting where the noise proportions are unknown and the   true class distributions are nonseparable and potentially   quite complex. We develop a procedure for decontamination   of the contaminated models from data, which then   facilitates the design of a consistent discrimination rule. Our   approach relies on a novel method for estimating the error   when projecting one distribution onto a convex combination   of others, where the projection is with respect to an   information divergence known as the separation distance.   Under sufficient conditions on the amount of noise and   purity of the base distributions, this projection procedure   successfully recovers the underlying class distributions. Connections to   novelty detection, topic modeling, and other learning problems are also   discussed.}

  author = {Carreira-Perpinan, Miguel and Wang, Weiran},
  pages = {10-19},
  abstract = {Intelligent processing of complex signals such as images is often performed by a hierarchy of nonlinear processing layers, such as a deep net or an object recognition cascade. Joint estimation of the parameters of all the layers is a difficult nonconvex optimization. We describe a general strategy to learn the parameters and, to some extent, the architecture of nested systems, which we call the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). This replaces the original problem involving a deeply nested function with a constrained problem involving a different function in an augmented space without nesting. The constrained problem may be solved with penalty-based methods using alternating optimization over the parameters and the auxiliary coordinates. MAC has provable convergence, is easy to implement reusing existing algorithms for single layers, can be parallelized trivially and massively, applies even when parameter derivatives are not available or not desirable, can perform some model selection on the fly, and is competitive with state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers even in the serial computation setting, often providing reasonable models within a few iterations.}

  abstract = {Variational Bayesian (VB) learning is known to be a   promising   approximation to Bayesian learning  with computational efficiency.  However, in some applications,  e.g., large-scale collaborative filtering and tensor factorization,  VB is still computationally too costly.  In such cases,   looser approximations  such as MAP estimation and partially Bayesian (PB) learning,  where a part of the parameters are point-estimated,  seem attractive.  In this paper,   we theoretically investigate the behavior of the MAP and the PB solutions of matrix factorization.  A notable finding is that the global solutions of MAP and PB in the empirical Bayesian scenario,  where the hyperparameters are also estimated from observation,  are trivial and useless,  while  their local solutions behave similarly to the global solution of VB.  This suggests that empirical MAP and empirical PB with local search can be alternatives to empirical VB  equipped with the useful automatic relevance determination property.  Experiments support our theory.}

  author = {Ailon, Nir},
  pages = {29-37},
  abstract = {Consider the following game: There is a fixed set $V$ of $n$ items.  At each step an adversary chooses a score function  $s_t:V\mapsto[0,1]$, a learner outputs a  ranking of $V$, and then $s_t$ is revealed.  The learner's loss is the sum over $v\in V$, of $s_t(v)$ times $v$'s  position ($0$th, $1$st, $2$nd, ...) in the ranking.  This problem captures, for example, online systems that iteratively present ranked lists of items to users, who then respond by choosing one (or more) sought items.  The loss measures the users' burden, which increases the further the sought items are from the top.  It also captures a version of online rank aggregation.      We present an algorithm of expected regret  $O(n\sqrt{OPT} + n^2)$, where OPT is the loss of the best (single) ranking in hindsight.   This improves the previously best known  algorithm of Suehiro et. al (2012) by saving a factor of $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$.  We also reduce the per-step running time  from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\log n)$.   We provide matching lower bounds.}

It then leverages this result for average-case analysis of high-dimensional block-sparse recovery and regression. In contrast to earlier works, the results of this paper are fundamentally different because (i) they provide conditions on arbitrary designs that can be explicitly computed in polynomial time, (ii) the provided conditions translate into near-optimal scaling of the number of observations with the number of active blocks of the design matrix, and (iii) they suggest that the spectral norm, rather than the column/block coherences, of the design matrix fundamentally limits the performance of computational methods in high-dimensional settings."}

Thanks to IBP's enhancements to the latent factors, NCFR can significantly avoid over-fitting even in the case of a very small sample size compared to the dimensionality. Experimental results on three diverse datasets comparing NCRF to a few baseline alternatives give evidence of its robust learning, remarkable predictive performance, good mixing and computational efficiency.}

This provides good motivations for developing algorithms for the NP-hard problem of learning optimal bounded treewidth Bayesian networks (BTW-BNSL). In this work, we develop a novel score-based approach to BTW-BNSL, based on casting BTW-BNSL as weighted partial Maximum satisfiability.

We estimate the expected size of a BN, the expected size increase of moralization, the expected size of the Markov blanket, and the maximum size of a minimal d-separator. We also provide an upper bound on the average time complexity of an algorithm for finding a minimal d-separator. In addition, the estimates are evaluated against BNs learned from real world data.}

Moreover, our theoretical analysis shows the universal existence of arbitrary low-rank stochastic gradients which in turn validates the rationale of  the LR-SGD method.

  abstract = {In finite decision problems where an agent can query its human user to obtain information about its environment before acting, a query's usefulness is in terms of its Expected Value of Information (EVOI). The usefulness of a query set is similarly measured in terms of the EVOI of the queries it contains. When the only constraint on what queries can be asked is that they have exactly k possible responses (with k >= 2), we show that the set of k-response decision queries (which ask the user to select his/her preferred decision given a choice of k decisions) is EVOI-Sufficient, meaning that no single k-response query can have higher EVOI than the best single k-response decision query for any decision problem. When multiple queries can be asked before acting, we provide a negative result that shows the set of  depth-n query trees constructed from k-response decision queries is not EVOI-Sufficient. However, we also provide a positive result that the set of depth-n query trees constructed from k-response decision-set queries, which ask the user to select from among k sets of decisions as to which set contains the best decision,  is EVOI-Sufficient. We conclude with a discussion and analysis of algorithms that draws on a connection to other recent work on decision-theoretic knowledge elicitation.}

For Foot-and-Mouth disease virus (FMDV), where multiple serotypes co-circulate, testing large numbers of vaccines can be infeasible. Therefore the development of an in silico predictor of cross-protection between strains is important to help optimise vaccine choice. Here we describe a novel sparse Bayesian variable selection model using spike and slab priors which is able to predict antigenic variability and identify sites which are important for the neutralisation of the virus. We are able to identify multiple residues which are known to be key indicators of antigenic variability. Many of these were not identified previously using Frequentist mixed-effects models and still cannot be found when an L1 penalty is used. We further explore how the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposal method for the inclusion of variables can offer significant reductions in computational requirements, both for spike and slab priors in general, and our hierarchical Bayesian model in particular.}

Focusing on the n-dimensional Gaussian location model, we derive exact asymptotic minimax results for estimation over truncated l^2-balls, which complement existing results for l^p-balls.  We then propose simple new adaptive thresholding estimators that are inspired by the truncated l^2-norm and are adaptive asymptotic minimax over l^p-balls (p < 2), as well as truncated l^2-balls.  Finally, we derive lower bounds on the Bayes risk of an estimator, in terms of the parameter's truncated l^2-norm.  These bounds provide necessary conditions for Bayes risk consistency in certain problems that are relevant for high-dimensional Bayesian modeling.}

In addition, our regularization includes image constraints such as a total variation penalization term and a new gradient penalization on the reconstructed PAN image. Our method does not require high resolution multiband images for dictionary learning, which are unavailable in practice, but rather the dictionary is learned directly on the reconstructed image as part of the inversion process. We present experiments on several images to validate our method and compare with several other well-known approaches.}

This approach also allows for answering a variety of questions probabilistically, which is suitable for exploratory pattern discovery and post-analysis by human experts. This framework is based on a fully-Bayesian learning of the structure of a switching dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) and utilizes a state-space approach to allow for noisy observations and missing data. It generalizes the autoregressive switching interaction model of Siracusa et al., which does not allow observation noise, and the switching linear dynamic system model of Fox et al., which does not infer interactions among signals. Posterior samples are obtained via a Gibbs sampling procedure, which is particularly efficient in the case of linear Gaussian dynamics and observation models. We demonstrate the utility of our framework on a controlled human-generated data, and a real-world climate data.}

  abstract = {In many real-world applications, the simplified assumption of independent and identically distributed noise breaks down, and labels can have structured, systematic noise. For example, in brain-computer interface applications, training data is often the result of lengthy experimental sessions, where the attention levels of participants can change over the course of the experiment. In such application cases, structured label noise will cause problems because most machine learning methods assume independent and identically distributed label noise. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for learning and evaluation in presence of systematic label noise. The core of which is a novel extension of support vector data description / one-class SVM that can incorporate latent variables. Controlled simulations on synthetic data and a real-world EEG  experiment with 20 subjects from the domain of brain-computer-interfacing show that our method achieves accuracies that go beyond the state of the art.}

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are a state-of-the-art method for learning    models from data. Data with an underlying periodic structure appears    in many areas, e.g., in climatology or robotics.  It is often    important to predict the long-term evolution of such a time series,    and to take the inherent periodicity explicitly into account.  In a    Gaussian process, periodicity can be accounted for by an appropriate kernel    choice. However, the standard periodic kernel does not allow for    analytic long-term forecasting, which requires to map distributions    through the Gaussian process.  To address this shortcoming, we re-parametrize the periodic kernel,    which, in combination with a double approximation, allows for    analytic long-term forecasting of a periodic state evolution with    Gaussian processes.  Our model allows for probabilistic long-term forecasting of periodic    processes, which can be valuable in Bayesian decision making,    optimal control, reinforcement learning, and robotics.}

Under the assumption that a treatment is associated with a response through a univariate supplementary variable in the framework of linear regression models, Cox (1960) showed that the estimation accuracy of the regression coefficient of the treatment on the response in the single linear regression model can be improved by using the recursive linear regression model based on the supplementary variable from the viewpoint of the asymptotic variance.   However, such assumptions may not hold in many practical situations.   In this paper, we consider the situation where a treatment is associated with a response through a set of supplementary variables in both linear and discrete models.   Then, we show that the estimation accuracy of the causal effect can be improved by using the supplementary variables.   Different from Cox (1960), the results of this paper are derived without the assumption of Gaussian error terms in linear models or dichotomous variables in discrete models.   The results of this paper help us to obtain the reliable evaluation of causal effects from observed data.}

As a result, it can perform well in situations where the number of arms is much larger than the number of allowed function evaluation, whereas the frequentist counterpart is inapplicable.

First we prove that the expected regret of TS with the uniform prior achieves the theoretical bound, which is the first result to show that the asymptotic bound is achievable for the normal distribution model. Next we prove that TS with Jeffreys prior and reference prior cannot achieve the theoretical bound.

The problem is technically challenging because the parametric part is unconstrained and the model is underdetermined, while the response is allowed to be unbounded with subgaussian tails. Under natural regularity conditions, we bound the generalization error as a function of the metric entropy of H and the dimension of the linear model. Our main tool is a ratio-type concentration inequality for increments of empirical processes, based on which we are able to give an exponential tail bound on the size of the parametric component. We also provide a comparison to alternatives of this technique and discuss why and when the unconstrained parametric part in the model may cause a problem in terms of the expected risk.

Most of these methods fail if the sample space is high-dimensional, and hence require a dimension reduction step, the result of which can be a significant loss of information. Here we propose a simple-to-implement, fully nonparametric density ratio estimator that expands the ratio in terms of the eigenfunctions of a kernel-based operator; these functions reflect the underlying geometry of the data (e.g., submanifold structure), often leading to better estimates without an explicit dimension reduction step.  We show how our general framework can be extended to address another important problem, the estimation of a likelihood function in situations where that function cannot be well-approximated by an analytical form. One is often faced with this situation when performing statistical inference with data from the sciences, due the complexity of the data and of the processes that generated those data. We emphasize applications where using existing likelihood-free methods of inference would be challenging due to the high dimensionality of the sample space, but where our spectral series method yields a reasonable estimate of the likelihood function.

To this end, we theoretically analyze the properties of a consistent estimator of a kernel mean, which is represented as a weighted sum of feature vectors. First, we prove that the weighted average of a function in a Besov space, whose weights and samples are given by the kernel mean estimator, converges to the expectation of the function. As corollaries, we show that the moments and the probability measures on intervals can be recovered from an estimate of the kernel mean.

Our approach is based on similar intuitions as semi-supervised support vector machines (S3VMs), but these intuitions are formalized in a probabilistic framework.  Within this framework we are able to derive an especially simple Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for learning.  The algorithm alternates between applying Bayes rule to ""fill in"" the latent variables (the E-step) and performing an unconstrained least-squares regression to update the weight vector (the M-step).  For the best results it is necessary to constrain the unlabeled data to have a similar ratio of positive to negative examples as the labeled data.  Within our model this constraint renders exact inference intractable, but we show that a Lyapunov central limit theorem (for sums of independent, but non-identical random variables) provides an excellent approximation to the true posterior distribution.

In practice, however, due to its cubic time complexity with respect to the rank of factor matrices, existing variational inference algorithms for BMF are not well suited to web-scale datasets where billions of ratings provided by millions of users are available. The time complexity even increases when the side information, such as user binary implicit feedback or item content information, is incorporated into variational Bayesian matrix factorization (VBMF). For instance, a state of the arts in VBMF with side information, is to place Gaussian priors on user and item factor matrices, where mean of each prior is regressed on the corresponding side information. Since this approach introduces additional cubic time complexity with respect to the size of feature vectors, the use of rich side information in a form of high-dimensional feature vector is prohibited. In this paper, we present a scalable inference for VBMF with side information, the complexity of which is linear in the rank K of factor matrices. Moreover, the algorithm can be easily parallelized on multi-core systems.

Experiments on multiple computer-vision data-bases, and using several types of classifiers, show that this class of methods outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, both in terms of speed and classification accuracy.}

  abstract = {Hidden Markov random fields (HMRFs) are conventionally assumed to be homogeneous in the sense that the potential functions are invariant across different sites. However in some biological applications, it is desirable to make HMRFs heterogeneous, especially when there exists some background knowledge about how the potential functions vary. We formally define heterogeneous HMRFs and propose an EM algorithm whose M-step combines a contrastive divergence learner with a kernel smoothing step to incorporate the background knowledge. Simulations show that our algorithm is effective for learning heterogeneous HMRFs and outperforms alternative binning methods. We learn a heterogeneous HMRF in a real-world study.}

  abstract = {Recent results have shown that the generalization error of structured predictors decreases with both the number of examples and the size of each example, provided the data distribution has weak dependence and the predictor exhibits a smoothness property called collective stability. These results use an especially strong definition of collective stability that must hold uniformly over all inputs and all hypotheses in the class. We investigate whether weaker definitions of collective stability suffice. Using the PAC-Bayes framework, which is particularly amenable to our new definitions, we prove that generalization is indeed possible when uniform collective stability happens with high probability over draws of predictors (and inputs). We then derive a generalization bound for a class of structured predictors with variably convex inference, which suggests a novel learning objective that optimizes collective stability.}

  abstract = {The selection of data collection locations is a problem that has received significant research attention from classical design of experiments to various recent active learning algorithms.  Typical objectives are to map an unknown function, optimize it, or find level sets in it.  Each of these objectives focuses on an assessment of individual points.  The introduction of set kernels has led to algorithms that instead consider labels assigned to sets of data points.  In this paper we combine these two concepts and consider the problem of choosing data collection locations when the goal is to identify regions whose set of collected data would be labeled positively by a set classifier.  We present an algorithm for the case where the positive class is defined in terms of a region's average function value being above some threshold with high probability, a problem we call active area search. To this end, we model the latent function using a Gaussian process and use Bayesian quadrature to estimate its integral on predefined regions.  Our method is the first which directly solves the active area search problem.  In experiments it outperforms previous algorithms that were developed for other active search goals.}

By reasoning about the entropy reduction and cost tradeoff, our algorithm actively selects the next annotation task.

  abstract = {Inference in large scale graphical models is an important task in many domains, and in particular for probabilistic relational models (e.g,. Markov logic networks). Such models often exhibit considerable symmetry, and it is a challenge to devise algorithms that exploit this symmetry to speed up inference.   Here we address this task in the context of the MAP inference problem and its linear programming relaxations. We show that symmetry in these problems  can be discovered using an elegant algorithm known as the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (k-WL) algorithm. We run k-WL on the original graphical model, and not on the far larger graph of the linear program (LP) as proposed in earlier work in the field. Furthermore, the algorithm is polynomial and thus far more practical than other previous approaches which rely on orbit partitions that are GI complete to find. The fact that k-WL can be used in this manner follows from the recently introduced notion of k-local LPs and their relation to Sherali Adams relaxations of graph automorphisms. Finally, for relational models such as Markov logic networks, the benefits of our approach are even more dramatic, as we can discover symmetries in the original domain graph, as opposed to running lifting on the much larger grounded model.}

On each round an algorithm receives an input and makes a prediction. Then, it can decide whether to query a label, and if so to update its model, otherwise the input is discarded. Most of this work is focused on the stationary case, where it is assumed that there is a fixed target model, and the performance of the algorithm is compared to a fixed model. However, in many real-world applications, such as spam prediction, the best target function may drift over time, or have shifts from time to time. We develop a novel selective sampling algorithm for the drifting setting, analyze it under no assumptions on the mechanism generating the sequence of instances, and derive new mistake bounds that depend on the amount of drift in the problem. Simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithms as a selective sampling algorithm in the drifting setting.}

Gibbs sampling at high temperature (i.e., with a very small subsample) can more quickly explore sketches of the final latent state by (a) making longer jumps around latent space (as in block Gibbs) and (b) lowering energy barriers (as in simulated annealing). We prove subsample annealing speeds up mixing time N^2 → N in a simple clustering model and exp(N) → N in another class of models, where N is data size. Empirically subsample-annealing outperforms naive Gibbs sampling in accuracy-per-wallclock time, and can scale to larger datasets and deeper hierarchical models.

This setting was recently studied in \cite{poczos2013distribution}, where the ``Kernel-Kernel'' estimator was introduced and shown to have a polynomial rate of convergence.   However, evaluating a new prediction with the Kernel-Kernel estimator scales as $\Omega(N)$. This causes the difficult situation where a large amount of data may be necessary for a low estimation risk, but the computation cost of estimation becomes infeasible when the data-set is too large. To this end, we propose the Double-Basis estimator, which looks to alleviate this big data problem in two ways: first, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a computation complexity that is independent of the number of of instances $N$ when evaluating new predictions after training; secondly, the Double-Basis estimator is shown to have a fast rate of convergence for a general class of mappings $f\in\calF$."}

In statistics, feature noise is known as``errors in variables'' and has been studied extensively in non-active settings. However, the effect of feature noise in active learning has not been studied before. We consider the well-known Berkson errors-in-variables model with additive uniform noise of width $\sigma$.    Our simple but revealing setting is that of one-dimensional binary classification setting where the goal is to learn a threshold (point where the probability of a $+$ label crosses half). We deal with regression functions that are antisymmetric in a region of size $\sigma$ around the threshold and also satisfy Tsybakov's margin condition around the threshold. We prove minimax lower and upper bounds which demonstrate that when $\sigma$ is smaller than the minimiax active/passive noiseless error derived in \cite{CN07}, then noise has no effect on the rates and one achieves the same noiseless rates. For larger $\sigma$, the \textit{unflattening} of the regression function on convolution with uniform noise, along with its local antisymmetry around the threshold, together yield a behaviour where noise \textit{appears} to be beneficial. Our key result is that active learning can buy significant improvement over a passive strategy even in the presence of feature noise.}

  pages = {859-867},
  abstract = {"In this paper, we present a new approach for lifted MAP inference in Markov Logic Networks (MLNs). Our approach is based on the following key result that we prove in the paper: if an MLN has no shared terms then MAP inference over it can be reduced to MAP inference over a Markov network having the following properties: (i) the number of random variables in the Markov network is equal to the number of first-order atoms in the MLN; and (ii) the domain size of each variable in the Markov network is equal to the number of groundings of the corresponding first-order atom. We show that inference over this Markov network is exponentially more efficient than ground inference, namely inference over the Markov network obtained by grounding all first-order atoms in the MLN. We improve this result further by showing that if non-shared MLNs contain no self joins, namely every atom appears at most once in each of its formulas, then all variables in the corresponding Markov network need only be bi-valued.  Our approach is quite general and can be easily applied to an arbitrary MLN by simply grounding all of its shared terms. The key feature of our approach is that because we reduce lifted inference to propositional inference, we can use any propositional MAP inference algorithm for performing lifted MAP inference. Within our approach, we experimented with two propositional MAP inference algorithms: Gurobi and MaxWalkSAT. Our experiments on several benchmark MLNs clearly demonstrate our approach is superior to ground MAP inference in terms of scalability and solution quality."}

  pages = {868-876},
  abstract = {The statistical dependencies which independent component analysis (ICA) cannot remove often provide rich information beyond the ICA components. It would be very useful to estimate the dependency structure from data. However, most models have concentrated on higher-order correlations such as energy correlations, neglecting linear correlations. Linear correlations might be a strong and informative form of a dependency for some real data sets, but they are usually completely removed by ICA and related methods, and not analyzed at all. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model of non-Gaussian components which are allowed to have both linear and energy correlations. The dependency structure of the components is explicitly parametrized by a parameter matrix, which defines an undirected graphical model over the latent components. Furthermore, the estimation of the parameter matrix is shown to be particularly simple because using score matching, the objective function is a quadratic form. Using artificial data, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to estimate non-Gaussian components and their dependency structures, as it is designed to do. When applied to natural images and outputs of simulated complex cells in the primary visual cortex, novel dependencies between the estimated features are discovered.}

  abstract = {We investigate the Student-t process as an alternative to the Gaussian process as a nonparametric prior over functions. We derive closed form expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process, by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel of a Gaussian process model.  We show surprising equivalences between different hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the attractive properties of a Gaussian process -- a nonparametric representation, analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through covariance kernels -- but has enhanced flexibility, and a predictive covariance that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depends on the values of training observations.  We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost over Gaussian processes.}

Deciding which LSH to use for a particular problem at hand is an important question, which has no clear answer in the existing  literature. In this study, we provide a theoretical answer (validated by experiments) that MinHash virtually always outperforms  SimHash when the data are binary, as common in practice such as search.      The collision probability of MinHash is a function of  {\em resemblance} similarity ($\mathcal{R}$), while the collision probability of SimHash is a function of  {\em cosine}  similarity ($\mathcal{S}$). To provide a common basis for  comparison,  we evaluate  retrieval results in terms of $\mathcal{S}$ for both MinHash and SimHash. This evaluation is valid  as we can prove that MinHash is  a valid LSH with respect to $\mathcal{S}$, by using a  general inequality  $\mathcal{S}^2\leq \mathcal{R}\leq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$. Our \textbf{worst case}  analysis  can show that MinHash significantly outperforms SimHash in  \textbf{high similarity} region.        Interestingly, our intensive experiments reveal that MinHash is also substantially better than SimHash even in datasets where most of the data points are not too similar to each other. This is partly because, in practical data, often $\mathcal{R}\geq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}$ holds where $z$ is only slightly larger than 2 (e.g., $z\leq 2.1$). Our \textbf{restricted worst case} analysis by assuming $\frac{\mathcal{S}}{z-\mathcal{S}}\leq \mathcal{R}\leq \frac{\mathcal{S}}{2-\mathcal{S}}$ shows that MinHash indeed significantly outperforms SimHash even in \textbf{low similarity} region.        We believe the results in this paper  will provide valuable guidelines for search in practice,  especially when the data are sparse.}

We propose several schemes for finding such reparameterizations, all of which leverage unique properties of zeros as well as research on LBP convergence done over the last decade. Our experimental evaluation on a variety of PGMs clearly demonstrates the promise of our method – it often yields accuracy and convergence time improvements of an order of magnitude or more over LBP.}

The representation is based on expanding periodic covariance functions into a series of stochastic resonators. The explicit representation of the canonical periodic covariance function is written out and the expansion is shown to uniformly converge to the exact covariance function with a known convergence rate. The framework is generalized to quasi-periodic covariance functions by introducing damping terms in the system and applied to two sets of real data. The approach could be easily extended to non-stationary and spatio-temporal variants.}

These methods classify initially unlabeled nodes by propagating label information over the structure of graph starting from seed nodes. Graph-based SSL algorithms usually scale linearly with the number of distinct labels (m), and require O(m) space on each node. Unfortunately, there exist many applications of practical significance with very large m over large graphs, demanding better space and time complexity. In this paper, we propose MAD-Sketch, a novel graph-based SSL algorithm which compactly stores label distribution on each node using Count-min Sketch, a randomized data structure. We present theoretical analysis showing that under mild conditions, MAD-Sketch can reduce space complexity at each node from O(m) to O(log(m)), and achieve similar savings in time complexity as well. We support our analysis through experiments on multiple real world datasets. We observe that MAD-Sketch achieves similar performance as existing state-of-the-art graph-based SSL algorithms, while requiring smaller memory footprint and at the same time achieving up to 10x speedup. We find that MAD-Sketch is able to scale to datasets with one million labels, which is beyond the scope of existing graph-based SSL algorithms.}

We study the effect, in theory and experiment, of approximating gradients in the optimization and show that the expected error is related to the mean curvature of the objective function, and that gradually increasing the accuracy level in the FMM over iterations leads to a faster training. When combined with standard optimizers, such as gradient descent or L-BFGS, the resulting algorithm beats the O(N.logN) Barnes-Hut method and achieves reasonable embeddings for one million points in around three hours' runtime.}

DoPinG uses two plugin procedures and consists of three steps: (1) estimate nonparametric correlations based on observed values,  including Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho; (2) estimate the non-paranormal correlation matrix; (3) plug into existing sparse precision estimators.   We prove that DoPinG copula estimators consistently estimate the non-paranormal correlation matrix at a rate of $O(\frac{1}{(1-\delta)}\sqrt{\frac{\log p}{n}})$, where $\delta$ is the probability of missing values.

We introduce a novel formulation of an empirical risk objective for the multi stage sequential decision problem. This objective naturally lends itself to a non-convex multilinear formulation. Nevertheless, we derive a novel perspective that leads to a tight convex objective. This is accomplished by expressing the empirical risk in terms of linear superposition of indicator functions. We then derive an LP formulation by utilizing hinge loss surrogates. Our LP achieves or exceeds the empirical performance as the non-convex alternating algorithm that requires a large number of random initializations. Consequently, the LP has the advantage of guaranteed convergence, global optimality, repeatability and computation efficiency.}

One of its shortcomings is that it requires auxiliary optimization of an acquisition function at each iteration. This auxiliary optimization can be costly and very hard to carry out in practice. Moreover, it creates serious theoretical concerns, as most of the convergence results assume that the exact optimum of the acquisition function can be found. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for efficient global optimization that combines Gaussian process confidence bounds and treed simultaneous optimistic optimization to eliminate the need for auxiliary optimization of acquisition functions. The experiments with global optimization benchmarks, as well as a novel application to automate information extraction, demonstrate that the resulting technique is more efficient than the two approaches from which it draws inspiration. Unlike most theoretical analyses of Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes, our convergence rate proofs do not require exact optimization of an acquisition function. That is, our approach eliminates the unsatisfactory assumption that a difficult, potentially NP-hard, problem has to be solved in order to obtain vanishing regret rates.}
