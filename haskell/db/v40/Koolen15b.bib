  abstract = {There has been much work on extending the prediction with
expert advice methodology to the case when experts are
composed of components and there are combinatorially many such experts.
One of the core examples is the Online Shortest Path problem
where the components are edges and the experts are paths.
In this note we revisit this online routing problem in the case
where in each trial some of the edges or components are sabotaged / blocked.
In the vanilla expert setting a known method can solve this
extension where experts are now awake or asleep in
each trial. We ask whether this technology can be upgraded efficiently to
the case when at each trial every component can be awake or asleep.
It is easy get to get an initial regret bound by using
combinatorially many experts. However it is open whether
there are efficient algorithms achieving the same regret.},
