  abstract = {Motivated by a sampling problem basic to
computational statistical inference,
we develop a toolset based on spectral sparsification
for a family of fundamental problems involving Gaussian sampling, matrix
functionals, and reversible Markov chains.
Drawing on the connection between Gaussian
graphical models and the recent breakthroughs in spectral graph theory,
we give the first nearly linear time algorithm for
the following basic matrix problem:
Given an $n\times n$ Laplacian matrix $\mathbf{M}$ and a constant $-1 \leq p \leq 1$,
provide efficient access to a sparse $n\times n$
linear operator $\tilde{\mathbf{C}}$ such that
$$\mathbf{M}^{p} \approx \tilde{\mathbf{C}} \tilde{\mathbf{C}}^\top,$$
where $\approx$ denotes spectral similarity.
When $p$ is set to $-1$, this gives the first parallel sampling algorithm
that is essentially optimal both in total work and randomness for
Gaussian random fields with symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD)
precision matrices.
It only requires {\em nearly linear work} and
$2n$ {\em i.i.d. random univariate
Gaussian samples} to generate an $n$-dimensional {\em i.i.d. Gaussian random sample}
in polylogarithmic depth.

The key ingredient of our approach is an integration of
spectral sparsification with multilevel method:
Our algorithms are based on factoring $\mathbf{M}^p$ into a product of
well-conditioned matrices, then introducing powers and
replacing dense matrices with sparse approximations.
We give two sparsification methods for this
approach that may be of independent interest.
The first invokes Maclaurin series on the factors,
while the second builds on our new nearly linear time
spectral sparsification
algorithm for random-walk matrix polynomials.
We expect these algorithmic advances
will also help to strengthen the connection
between machine learning and spectral graph theory,
two of the most active fields in understanding large data and networks.
