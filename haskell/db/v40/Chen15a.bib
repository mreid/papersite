  abstract = {The problem of learning the solution space of an unknown formula
has been studied in multiple embodiments in computational learning theory.
In this article, we study a family of such learning problems;
this family contains,
for each relational structure, the problem of learning
the solution space of an unknown conjunctive query
evaluated on the structure.
A progression of results aimed to classify the learnability
of each of the problems in this family, and thus far
a culmination thereof was a positive learnability result
generalizing all previous ones.
This article completes the classification program
towards which
this progression of results strived,
by presenting a negative learnability result that
complements the mentioned positive learnability result.
In order to obtain our negative result, we make use
of universal-algebraic concepts, and our result
is phrased in terms of the varietal property of
non-congruence modularity.},
