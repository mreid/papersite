  abstract = {We present a simple, general technique for reducing the sample
complexity of matrix and tensor decomposition algorithms applied to distributions. We use the technique to
give a polynomial-time algorithm for standard ICA with
sample complexity nearly linear in the dimension, thereby improving substantially on previous bounds. The analysis is based
on properties of random polynomials, namely the spacings of an
ensemble of polynomials. Our technique also applies to other applications of tensor decompositions, including spherical Gaussian mixture models.},
