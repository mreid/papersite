  abstract = {The matrix completion problem consists in
reconstructing a matrix from a sample of
entries, possibly observed with noise.
A popular class of estimator, known as nuclear norm penalized estimators,
are based on minimizing the sum of a data fitting term and a nuclear norm
penalization.
Here, we investigate the case where
the noise distribution
belongs to the exponential
family and is sub-exponential.
Our framework allows for a general sampling scheme.
We first consider
an estimator defined as the minimizer of the sum
of a log-likelihood term and a nuclear norm penalization
and prove an upper bound
on the Frobenius prediction risk. The rate obtained improves on
previous works on matrix completion for exponential family.
When the sampling distribution is known,
we propose another estimator and prove an oracle inequality
{\em w.r.t.} the Kullback-Leibler prediction risk, which translates immediately
into an upper bound on the Frobenius prediction risk. Finally, we show that all the rates obtained
are minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor.},
