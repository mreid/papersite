  abstract = {We propose a non-parametric anomaly detection algorithm for high dimensional data. We score each datapoint by its average $K$-NN distance, and rank them  accordingly. We then train limited complexity models to imitate these scores based on the max-margin learning-to-rank framework. A test-point is declared as an anomaly at $\alpha$-false  alarm level if the predicted score is in the $\alpha$-percentile. The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that for any false alarm rate $\alpha$, its decision region converges to the $\alpha$-percentile minimum volume level set of the unknown underlying density. In addition, we test both the statistical performance and computational efficiency of our algorithm on a number of synthetic and real-data experiments. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing $K$-NN based anomaly detection algorithms, with significant computational savings.},
