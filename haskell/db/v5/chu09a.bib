  abstract = {In multiway data, each sample is measured by multiple sets of  correlated attributes. We develop a probabilistic framework for  modeling structural dependency from partially observed  multi-dimensional array data, known as pTucker. Latent components  associated with individual array dimensions are jointly retrieved  while the core tensor is integrated out. The resulting algorithm  is capable of handling large-scale data sets. We verify the  usefulness of this approach by comparing against classical models  on applications to modeling amino acid fluorescence, collaborative  filtering and a number of benchmark multiway array data.},
