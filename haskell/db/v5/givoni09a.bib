  abstract = {Recently, affinity propagation (AP) was introduced  as an unsupervised learning algorithm for  exemplar based clustering. Here we extend the  AP model to account for semi-supervised clustering.  AP, which is formulated as inference in  a factor-graph, can be naturally extended to account  for ?instance-level? constraints: pairs of  data points that cannot belong to the same cluster  (cannot-link), or must belong to the same cluster  (must-link). We present a semi-supervised AP algorithm  (SSAP) that can use instance-level constraints  to guide the clustering. We demonstrate  the applicability of SSAP to interactive image  segmentation by using SSAP to cluster superpixels  while taking into account user instructions regarding  which superpixels belong to the same object.  We demonstrate SSAP can achieve better  performance compared to other semi-supervised  methods.},
