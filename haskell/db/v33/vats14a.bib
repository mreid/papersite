  abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenging problem of selecting tuning parameters for high-dimensional sparse regression.  We propose a simple and computationally efficient method, called path thresholding PaTh, that transforms any tuning parameter-dependent sparse regression algorithm into an asymptotically tuning-free sparse regression algorithm.  More specifically, we prove that, as the problem size becomes large (in the number of variables and in the number of observations), PaTh performs accurate sparse regression, under appropriate conditions, without specifying a tuning parameter.  In finite-dimensional settings, we demonstrate that PaTh can alleviate the computational burden of model selection algorithms by significantly reducing the search space of tuning parameters.},
