  abstract = {The best arm identification problem (BEST-1-ARM) is the most basic pure exploration
problem in stochastic multi-armed bandits.
The problem has a long history and attracted significant attention
for the last decade.
However, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the
optimal sample complexity of the problem:
The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity
of $O(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}(\ln\delta^{-1} + \ln\ln\Delta_i^{-1}))$
($\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$ mean), while the best known lower bound is $\Omega(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \Delta_{i}^{-2}\ln\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\Omega(\Delta^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances.
We propose to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem.
Previous work has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal
algorithm for the 2-arm problem.
However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term
$\Omega(\Delta_2^{-2} \ln\ln \Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem),
there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM.
Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise lower bound.
Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer
to the old and basic problem.},
