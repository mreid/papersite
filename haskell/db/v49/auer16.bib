  abstract = {We present an algorithm that achieves almost optimal pseudo-regret bounds against adversarial and stochastic bandits. Against adversarial bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(K\sqrt{n \log n})$ and against stochastic bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(\sum_i (\log n)/\Delta_i)$. We also show that no algorithm with $O(\log n)$ pseudo-regret against stochastic bandits can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ expected regret against adaptive adversarial bandits. This complements previous results of Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) that show $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ expected adversarial regret with $O((\log n)^2)$ stochastic pseudo-regret.
