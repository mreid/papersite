  abstract = {We consider algorithmic problems in the setting in which the input data has been partitioned arbitrarily on many servers. The goal is to compute a function of all the data, and the bottleneck is the communication used by the algorithm. We present algorithms for two illustrative problems on massive data sets: (1) computing a low-rank approximation of a matrix $A=A^1 + A^2 + \ldots + A^s$, with matrix $A^t$ stored on server $t$ and (2) computing a function of a vector $a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_s$, where server $t$ has the vector $a_t$; this includes the well-studied special case of computing frequency moments and separable functions, as well as higher-order correlations such as the number of subgraphs of a specified type occurring in a graph. For both problems we give algorithms with nearly optimal communication, and in particular the only dependence on $n$, the size of the data, is in the number of bits needed to represent indices and words ($O(\log n)$). },
