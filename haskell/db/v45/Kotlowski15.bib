  abstract = {We consider optimization of generalized performance metrics for binary classification
by means of surrogate loss.  We focus on a class of metrics, which are linear-fractional functions
of the false positive and false negative rates (examples of which include $F_{\beta}$-measure,
Jaccard similarity coefficient, AM measure, and many others).
Our analysis concerns the following two-step procedure. First, a real-valued function
$f$ is learned by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification on the training sample.
It is assumed that the surrogate loss
is a strongly proper composite loss function (examples of which include
logistic loss, squared-error loss, exponential loss, etc.). Then, given $f$, a threshold $\hat{\theta}$ is
tuned on a separate validation sample, by direct optimization of the target performance measure.
We show that the regret of the resulting classifier (obtained from thresholding $f$ on $\hat{\theta}$) 
measured with respect to the target metric is upperbounded by the regret of $f$ measured with respect
to the surrogate loss. 
Our finding is further analyzed
in~a~computational study on both synthetic and real data~sets.},
